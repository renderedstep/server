# Measuring whether a change made the game better

> *"I'm fine with the loop being manual initially. I just want more confidence
> that changes we are making are improving results."*

This is the protocol for getting that confidence, and the first thing it has to
tell you is how easy it is to fool yourself.

**Generated runs are model output. Run the same code over the same world twice
and the numbers move.** On the baseline this was built with, one unchanged
configuration produced between **1 and 13** `third_person_protagonist` flags on
the same twenty turns of the same world — a rate of 0.050 on one run and 0.650
on another, with nothing at all changed between them. That is wider than almost
any improvement anybody is going to claim. So no number in this loop is reported
without the spread of the runs that produced it, and no before/after is reported
without a verdict that can say *noise*.

## The rule this whole file exists to serve

**Always have a baseline for evaluating a prompt before deciding to change it.**

It is not advice about rigour, it is the order of operations. Before editing
the narrator's instructions (the engine's `data/scene/narrator.yml`), a
character's instructions, the classifier's instructions
(`data/playthrough/classifier.yml`), `Location::Generator`'s people, items,
naming and exits instructions, a schema's field descriptions or anything else a
model is handed:

1. **Store a baseline first.** `rake eval:prompt` is the cheap first gate,
   `rake eval:run` the confirming one, `rake eval:classifier` the classifier's
   and `rake eval:realization` the room-builder's. Sets live under `db/eval/`
   and `db/eval_baseline.json` and re-score offline for free, so the before half
   costs nothing once it exists.
2. **Judge the after against it with a verdict that can say *noise***
   — `rake eval:prompt_compare` / `rake eval:compare`, four runs a side.
3. **Re-baseline only once the change has a verdict.**

A prompt change with no before is not a change anybody can defend, and this
file's opening paragraph is why: the spread of an unchanged configuration is
wider than most improvements anybody claims.

### Historical vocabulary allowlist

Some recorded measurements contain superseded process wording or literal tool
paths. Those bytes identify what actually ran; rewriting them would make the
evidence claim it measured different input. Vocabulary checks therefore allow
existing matches only in:

- `db/eval/physical-classifier-20260910/historical-339-corpus.yml`;
- `db/eval/physical-classifier-20260910/source/{classifier.rb.txt,classifier_corpus.yml}`;
- `db/eval/physical-classifier-revised-20260910/source/{classifier.rb.txt,classifier_corpus.yml}`;
- `db/eval/physical-classifier-final-20260914/source/{classifier.rb.txt,classifier_corpus.yml}`;
- `db/eval/physical-realization-20260910/legacy/corpus.yml`; and
- `db/eval/adversarial-20260909/{README.md,confirmation-manifest.json}`.

This exception preserves provenance, not preferred wording. It does not permit
new matches, renamed copies or edits to the recorded bytes.

## Conversations with durable experience

The generic single-turn prompt bench excludes `talk`, which has two model
passes. The matched NPC experience corpus in
[`db/eval/experience-20260910`](db/eval/experience-20260910/README.md) stores both
passes, the actual engine receipt, and attributed memory fixtures. Its README
owns the measured results, limitations, and offline replay command. Use this
corpus when changing a character's memory or injury context; inspect and
store a new baseline first when a change needs a feature these fixtures lack.

## Physical actions and generated item profiles

[`db/eval/physical-20260910`](db/eval/physical-20260910/README.md) retains matched
physical-action runs, targeted generation profiles, manual annotations and an
offline `Eval::Noise` comparison. Its README separates actual effects, prose
contradictions and temporal mistakes, including the first candidate's failed
narration and the revised result. These fixed fixtures complement the broader
realization bench; they do not establish general realism.

Changes to physical-intent routing also need the full classifier corpus. The
[initial classifier study](db/eval/physical-classifier-20260910/README.md)
found a real intent regression on unrelated commands despite successful targeted
physical fixtures. Keep the full per-line answers so comparisons can exclude
explicitly amended labels and measure unchanged cases independently. An old
label that treated handing an item to an NPC as a floor drop cannot judge the
new offer branch; changing that label does not excuse errors on reading,
putting down or movement. Preserve failed candidates as evidence before trying
another prompt.

## The one command

```bash
rake eval:run                 # generate across the three seeded worlds, then print a board
```

Defaults to 5 repetitions of each world's 20-turn script — 15 runs, 300 turns,
**roughly $0.39**. It prints the estimate before it spends anything and the
actual figure on the board afterwards. It refuses to start without
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and it aborts rather than spend more than $1.00 unattended
(`YES=1` overrides).

| knob | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `REPS=8` | repetitions per world. **Four is the minimum for a verdict** — see the rule below |
| `TURNS=4` | stop each run after n turns. Cheap smoke test |
| `EVAL_MODEL=…` | pin a different model (see below) |
| `STORIES="The Salt Assizes"` | one world instead of three |
| `SET=main` | name the run set. Defaults to a timestamp |
| `SAMPLE=60` | how many flagged turns the board prints in full |
| `EVAL_RUN_TIMEOUT=1200` | seconds one run may take before it is killed. A killed run leaves no manifest and is simply absent from the scoring |
| `CONCURRENCY=3` | runs in flight at once. One per world by default |

Everything else is free and offline:

```bash
rake eval:score SET=main      # score a set again -- no model call, no key, no network
rake 'eval:read[The Salt Assizes,1]'   # one whole run as prose, every turn, flagged or not
rake eval:compare BEFORE=main AFTER=my-branch
rake eval:null SET=main       # split one set in half; everything should read NOISE
rake eval:estimate REPS=8     # what a sweep of that shape would cost, and what a bench baseline costs
rake eval:manifest            # the measurement files, with a digest of each
```

The run databases live under `tmp/eval/<set>/runs/`. They are not checked in and
they are large; `scores.json` beside them is the durable artifact, and
`eval:compare` reads only that, so a set can be compared long after its
databases are gone.


### Reading a run, when a board looks too clean

The board prints what a check **caught** — that is the point of it. When you want
the opposite, `rake eval:read` prints one whole run as prose: every turn in
order, what was typed, the passage the player would have read, and a mark
against any turn a check flagged.

```bash
rake 'eval:read[The Salt Assizes,1]' SET=main
```

**A turn with no mark is a turn every check passed.** Those are the ones to read
when a rate of zero looks suspicious: a clean board is only worth something if
the turns behind it hold up. The seeded worlds are also playable in the browser
(`bin/dev`), which is the other way to check the same thing.

---

## The before/after protocol

This is the thing to actually use on a change.

```bash
git switch main
rake eval:run SET=before REPS=8         # ~$0.63

git switch my-branch
rake eval:run SET=after  REPS=8         # ~$0.63

rake eval:compare BEFORE=before AFTER=after
```

Read the output in this order:

1. **Was the change real?** Per check, per corpus: `REAL`, `NOISE` or
   `INCONCLUSIVE`.
2. **What did it cost?** The `RICHNESS` row, directly underneath. A check that
   improved for real while richness fell for real is a warning printed in words,
   because that trade has to be taken on purpose.
3. **Did it hold on the world it was not tuned on?** The held-out corpus is
   printed separately and never pooled.

### The free gate in front of all of it: can the bench see the change?

**A bench whose staged worlds lack the feature cannot measure a prompt block
that renders on records.** Both benches play a fixed corpus over a fixed set of
worlds, so a block guarded on a story having something -- an arc, a mechanic, a
population -- renders EMPTY for every case in a corpus whose worlds have none of
it, and the after side is the before side bought twice.

So before planning any spend, prove the prompt actually moves:
New prompt, realization and classifier sets also record `request_identity`,
a versioned digest beside the legacy fields. Compute it without a key or a
model call with `rake eval:prompt_digest` (`CORPUS=ending` for the ending
scaffold), `rake eval:realization_digest`, or `rake eval:classifier_digest`.
The boards, scores and comparisons print it. A historical set without the
field says **no schema identity recorded**: it remains a valid before side,
with no invented claim about its old schema. A recorded mismatch follows the
bench's existing prompt mismatch policy (classifier: warning).

The identity hashes rendered system/user messages and the emitted JSON schema,
including descriptions, enums, required lists and nested bounds. It is a
**designated request scaffold**, not a full conversation identity. Main prompt cases
use the lowest id per shape. Ending request v2 covers every ending case: the
production builder is re-rendered with placeholders for the preceding scene's
generated description and summary. The live prompt and both verbatim prelude
fields are retained alongside that stable scaffold; legacy `prompt_stable`
continues to report live variation. Historical ending identities remain v1,
which used fixed synthetic prelude prose solely for assembly. Realization uses the same designated cases, renders every
supported people count with fixed slot data, and retains the literal directions
that the legacy line scrub erased. Classifier uses the lowest labelled line's
staged position; seed-owned names and list sizes remain covered, while database
ids and unrelated rolls never enter its request. Generated assistant detail
before exits, generated ending prelude variations, and undesignated branches
are outside this identity. No schema baseline can be recovered for older sets
that never recorded one; re-buying remains a separate measurement task.

`rake eval:realization_digest` is free, offline and keyless and says whether the
prompts this tree would send are the ones a stored set measured. For the prompt
bench, digest the narration context over the corpus the same way. Two things
that catch here:

- **The block renders empty and the digest does not move.** Then there is
  nothing to buy. Judge the change on **record-only tests over every branch of
  the block**, and add one test that reads the bench's own staged worlds and
  FAILS the day one of them gains the feature, so the round gets bought when it
  can finally say something --
  `Location::GeneratorArcTest#the_bench_worlds_send_an_unchanged_prompt` is the
  worked example, and `ta-story-arc` is the change that needed it.
- **The digest moves and the prompt text did not.** An empty interpolation on a
  line of its own moved the realization digest for all nine shapes: a paid round
  to measure one newline. Append rather than interpolate, and re-read the digest.
- **A whole PASS the corpus cannot reach.** Stronger than an empty block, and
  the answer is a SECOND CORPUS rather than a second thought. `Scene::Ending` is
  a prose call made only on the turn a playthrough's main arc concludes, and
  neither world `prompt_corpus.yml` plays has a `quests:` block at all -- so no
  case in it can end a game and the ending prompt could not be sent, let alone
  measured. What that does NOT license is adding the cases in place: `.digest` is
  over the cases, so the checked-in baseline would stop being a before side for
  the ninety it really measured. `prompt_ending_corpus.yml` is the answer --
  its own file, its own digest, its own kept sets, and a second world root
  (`Eval::Prompt::WORLD_ROOTS`) so it can play the one world with an arc. See
  **The ending's own corpus** below.

And the money gate beside it: **`rake eval:estimate` is the only command that
prices a bench without buying it.** `rake eval:realization` prints an estimate
and then spends in the same breath -- its `YES=1` confirmation fires only above
that task's `SPEND_CEILING`, which an ordinary four-rep round is nowhere near.

### The rule, and why it is this rule

A check is **REAL** when a two-sided exact rank test on the per-run rates
separates the two sets at p ≤ 0.05. **NOISE** when it does not and the
difference is no larger than the spread the unchanged runs already produced.
**INCONCLUSIVE** otherwise — in practice, almost always *not enough runs*.

The test is a permutation test on ranks rather than a t-test because flag counts
per run are small integers, frequently zero, and nothing about them is normal.
It asks: of all the ways these runs could have been split between "before" and
"after", how many separate at least this well?

**Four runs a side is the floor, and it is arithmetic rather than taste:**

| runs a side | arrangements | smallest p the test can return |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 20 | 0.100 — **above 0.05, so no verdict is reachable** |
| 4 | 70 | 0.029 |
| 5 | 252 | 0.008 |

At three a side, a *perfect* separation — every run of one set worse than every
run of the other — still cannot clear 0.05. Reporting anything but
`INCONCLUSIVE` there would be reporting the sample size as a result.

`rake eval:null` is the self-check: it splits one set's runs in half and compares
them. Both halves are the same code over the same worlds, so **any `REAL` there
is the protocol manufacturing a result**. Run it whenever the rule changes.

### What reduces the noise, in the order worth reaching for

1. **More turns per run.** The cheapest: it enlarges the denominator without
   another process start. The scripts went from 11 turns to 20 on 2026-09-03 for
   exactly this reason, and **it worked on one world and not on another** — The
   Unrecorded Hour's band more than halved (0.455 wide to 0.200) while The Lunar
   Cartographer's widened (0.455 to 0.600), because one of its eight runs turned
   in a single flag where its siblings turned in six to thirteen. A bigger
   denominator steadies a rate that is already stable; it does not stop a run
   wandering off on its own. What the extra turns did buy outright is the
   held-out world, which at eleven turns never fired the check at all.
2. **More repetitions.** Linear in money and the only thing that improves the
   test's resolution. **Prompt caching does not make them cheaper and was
   measured, not assumed**: OpenRouter caches automatically for the pinned model,
   but the minimum cacheable prompt is 2,048 tokens and this app's calls average
   615, so eighteen real prompts replayed back to back read zero cached tokens.
   Even a perfect cache would only take a $0.47 sweep to $0.36. See the header of
   `Eval::Cost` and `script/cache_probe.rb`.
3. **Pinning the model**, which the runner already does — a turn answered after
   a rotation is a different measurement.

Temperature is deliberately **not** on that list. The sweep has to measure the
game a player gets; a run at a temperature the app never uses is a measurement
of a different app.

## What the checks miss, and how that was found

Every check on the board is measured for false positives before it ships. **None
of them is measured for recall, and there is no way to measure it** — the errors
a check does not name are not enumerable. The substitute is reading a run: pick a
run the board scored **clean** and read it end to end against the records, since
that is where a missed defect hides. `rake eval:read SET=… STORY=… REP=…` prints
one for exactly this.

One pass over a zero-flag run of the held-out world, on 2026-09-03, found two
defects that every check passed:

1. **The narration denies the `take` and invents the pickup on the `drop`** — 30
   of 32 and 5 of 32 turns across the whole 480-turn baseline. It is invisible
   because every check reads one scene against the state it was written against,
   and this is a claim about a **transition**: the prose and the records agree
   about who holds the thing and disagree about whether anything happened.
2. **The generated arrival cast drops characters the world is about**, and
   nothing can contradict it, because no record says where a character is.

The first has since been fixed and is guarded by `take_denied` and
`pickup_invented`; the second is answered by `characters.location_id` and
`Character.present_in`. The lesson for anybody adding a check: **a board of
zeroes is a claim about the checks, not about the game.** One read of one clean
run cost twenty minutes and found a defect on 94% of a mechanic the app owns.

---

## The classifier bench

Everything above measures **narration**. This measures the one model call the
engine *acts* on.

`Playthrough::Classifier` runs on every turn and turns a typed line into a
branch and a record: a `move` writes `playthroughs.current_location_id`, a
`take` moves an `items` row, a `talk` picks which character prompt gets built.
Without the classifier bench, nothing scored whether it was right.
`Playthrough::Drift` and `Playthrough::Overreach` count its misses *indirectly*
and **neither knows the answer** — a drift row is written whether the player
reached for a door that is not there or the model failed to see a door that is.

**That gap costs the player something.** A wrong resolution is a refusal
somebody reads
and a wrong `also_named` refuses a line that should have played. So:

```bash
rake eval:classifier                    # 339 labelled lines x 4 reps x 2 models, ~$0.44
rake eval:classifier_offline            # the same corpus with NO model -- free, and in CI
rake eval:classifier_omission           # the also_named omission rate alone (~30 lines)
rake eval:classifier_compare BEFORE=a AFTER=b
```

| knob | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `REPS=4` | repetitions. **Four is the default because four is `Eval::Noise::MIN_RUNS`** — a run taken at the default can actually be judged later |
| `MODELS=a,b` | **the arm selector.** Names exactly which models the run measures; the app's rotation is not consulted. A bare id is OpenRouter, `ollama:qwen3:8b` names the provider. Defaults to `BaseAgent::REMOTE_MODEL_IDS`, which is what a player gets |
| `SET=name` | where the numbers land (`tmp/eval/<set>/classifier.json`). Defaults to a timestamp |
| `SAMPLE=20` | how many missed lines the board prints in full |
| `CASCADE=1` | **measure the typed-line cascade, not the model call alone.** See below |
| `YES=1` | spend past the $0.50 ceiling |

### Measuring the cascade, and what a cascade set must carry

Every set above pins the reader OFF (`system_one: false`), so the figures are
the Mistral call alone whatever the maintainer has in their shell — without that
pin, a shell holding either System One credential would quietly score a
different reader against the corpus and the board would print an arm's name over
another reader's answers.

`CASCADE=1` lifts that pin to "the environment decides", which is what a live
turn gets. An arm may also pin the Jev transport with `+typesafe-direct` or
`+openrouter-decisions` (same suffix style as `+tool` / `+tools`), which implies
a cascade measurement and constructs a `SystemOneAgent` for that route so the
two transports can be compared like for like. It does **not** name a different
escalation model: the arm is still the escalation target, so a cascade set and
the kept Mistral-alone set pair on that arm and `rake eval:classifier_compare`
judges them with nothing else to wire up. The `cascade` field on the set is the
only thing that tells them apart, and the board labels the column `(cascade)` so
a cross-model table cannot show two identical headers over two different things.
The task refuses to start without the selected transport's credential, because a
cascade run with no key measures the Mistral-only path and files itself under
the cascade's name.

**A cascade set keeps its per-line rows, and no other kept classifier set does.**
Each row carries `resolved_by`, the two probabilities the cascade acted on
(`target_present` and `named_more_than_one`), and `system_one_transport` naming
which Jev HTTP route answered. No new `scenes` column is needed: typed calls
leave no chat receipt, `scenes.resolved_by` already names the path family, and
a transport comparison is read off the kept bench rows. This is not a
preference: the questions a cascade raises are *which flag fired on which
lines*, and four aggregate numbers a side can never answer one.
`Result#summary(keep_rows: true)` is the escape hatch that keeps them.

**Two things a cascade set cannot tell you, stated so they are not assumed:**

* `request_identity` describes the **model call** — the instructions, prompt and
  schema the classifier sends. The System One request is not in that
  digest, so two cascade sets taken either side of a change to
  the System One request carry the *same* identity. The set's own
  README is what records the change; the digest cannot.
* the **spend** printed for a cascade run is the escalation provider's only. A
  line the cascade composed never reached the arm, so the run prices the calls
  it actually made and says how many it left out — but the System One request
  every line pays for has no row in the cost registry and no receipt here.

**And the STATE is as much of the request as the wording is.** The measured
shape is a key order, an empty block sent as an empty map, and an intent list
that leads with its block's own intent — the engine's `cascade::State` builds
all three, and the `classifier_request` vector portion holds a staged position
against the arm's own stored request byte for byte. That comparison is free,
and it is the first thing to run when a cascade reading disagrees with a stored
one.

The worked example is three sets, in order:

| set | wording | state | whole-answer | escalation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `classifier-cascade-before-20260919` | shipped | shipped | .9184–.9271 | .1720–.1895 |
| `classifier-cascade-restored-20260919` | restored | shipped | .9184–.9300 | .1749–.1808 |
| `classifier-cascade-state-20260919` | restored | restored | **.9388–.9417** | **.2536–.2653** |

The wording change alone was **NOISE on every figure**; the state change was
**REAL** on accuracy, refusal agreement and closed-set misses. Two lessons in
that, both cheap to forget:

* **a per-line correlation is not a measurement.** The second set's rows pointed
  at the state and a correlation over the three dozen divergent lines *failed to
  convict it* — 13 of 24 sat in positions with no missing key at all. The
  four-repetition run convicted it. Read the second set's README for the shape
  of that mistake.
* **the second-name count cannot judge the `also_named` wording.** 117 of the
  128 readings whose label carries a second name escalate, so the cascade's own
  `also_named` answer is read on about one line in twelve of the ones that
  question was measured on.

`classifier-cascade-state-20260919` was the cascade's kept set until the
checked-in worlds gained arcs; `classifier-cascade-state-20260927` is the same
request re-bought on them, and on today's worlds its lead over the model call
alone is **inside the noise**. Read both READMEs before changing anything about
the cascade.

### What it measures

Every figure is printed as **min..max with the median in the middle**, per
model, never pooled — the same discipline as the prose loop, and for the same
reason: the classifier runs at `TEMPERATURE = 0.0` and a provider is *still* not
deterministic.

| figure | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| `strict_accuracy` | **the headline.** The whole answer — intent *and* record — over the lines whose English admits one reading |
| `accuracy` | the same over every line, arguable ones included |
| `intent_accuracy` | the branch right, whatever record it landed on |
| `refusal_agreement` | whether the line earned the refusal `Playthrough::Refusal` gives it |
| `closed_set_misses` | **right branch, wrong record** — a count, not a rate, because it is the failure the closed enum exists to prevent |
| `latency_median` | seconds the median call took. What a turn usually costs the player |
| `latency_p95` | seconds the worst call in twenty took. On a local model this is not the same number |
| `failures` | calls that failed outright. **A slow arm and a flaky arm read differently**, so this is printed beside the latency and compared with it |

Beside them: **accuracy per intent** (six branches with six different
consequences), a **confusion matrix**, **`also_named` precision and recall** (it
is a detector, so it has two ways to be wrong), the **omission rate**, and the
**offline floor**. Every missed line is printed with what was typed, what was
expected and what came back — the same rule `rake game:score` follows.

### The corpus

`test/fixtures/files/classifier_corpus.yml` — **339 hand-labelled lines across
12 positions in the three seeded worlds.** YAML rather than JSON like its four
siblings, because every line carries a `why` and three hundred of those in JSON
is a file nobody audits. It grew by 39 in combat slice 8, when `attack` became
the seventh classifier intent — **a corpus that grows is a denominator that
moved**, and `rake eval:classifier_compare` prints its own warning when the two
sets it is given scored different digests. Compare the shared lines, or say out
loud that you did not.

A line names a **position** — a seeded world, a room, and the typed lines that
get to the state the label was written against — because a classifier answer is
only meaningful next to the closed sets the model was offered. `take the apron`
resolves to a record in the supply closet and to nothing in the office.

**How the labels were verified**, which is the part worth being suspicious of:

1. **The closed sets were read off the records and printed**, not read out of
   the seed file. Every `target` and `also_named` was written against that
   printout.
2. **`Eval::Classifier::Corpus#problems` checks every name back** against the
   set the action really reads (`Playthrough::Classifier#offered_for`), and
   `Eval::Classifier::CorpusTest` fails the build if one does not fit. A label
   naming something out of reach cannot survive a commit.
3. **`refusal:` is redundant on purpose.** The three kinds are derivable from
   intent, target and `also_named` through the same predicates
   `Playthrough::Classifier::Intent#refused?` uses; the validator derives them
   and compares. Two readings of one line have to agree.
4. **What neither can check** is whether the label is the right reading of the
   English. That is the hand-verification, line by line, and `why` states it.
   **56 of the 339 lines carry `also_accept`** — a second answer the bench
   counts as correct — because their English really does admit two readings, and
   the headline rate excludes them.

Where the lines came from: **the 61 stored classifier conversations in the
development database** (`chats.purpose = "classifier"`, kept since PR 97 —
what a person really typed, with the room and the sets the model was really
shown), **the 60 turns of the `rake eval:run` scripts**, and load-bearing
shapes that no one had yet typed. `unreadable` is deliberately
absent: it is an `intent` outside the closed enum, so no typed line can provoke
it.

### Adding a corpus line

Put it under the shape it belongs to, give it a `why`, and run
`bin/rails test test/lib/eval/classifier/corpus_test.rb`. If the shape you need
is not reachable from any position, **add a position rather than stretching an
existing label**. A position may carry `setup:` (typed lines, walked offline
through the fixed grammar) and `cast:` (a whereabouts written through
`Character#move_to!` — the one thing no typed line can do, and the only way two
people in one room is reachable at all).

### Speed, and the arm selector

**An arm is one model with nothing behind it.** `MODELS=` names it —
`mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1`, or `ollama:qwen3:8b` for a local model — and
`Eval::Classifier::Arm#pinned` replaces
`BaseAgent.default_model_options` for the length of that arm's passes. Nothing
in `app/` changes: `REMOTE_MODEL_IDS` is untouched, `OPENROUTER_MODEL` is not
read, and `TA_LOCAL_MODELS` still defaults to off — it gates the *app's*
rotation, and an arm **replaces** the rotation rather than joining it.

A local spec may carry a **`+nothink`** suffix, which is the one thing an arm
changes about the request itself and the reason it is spelled out in the label:
see *A local model, and the reasoning block in front of the answer* below.

**The rotation being off is the point, not a side effect.** `BaseAgent#ask`
retries only while `attempts < @model_options.count`, so an arm of one never
retries. Three things follow, all of them wanted in a measurement:

- **No cross-contamination.** The first remote baseline pinned with
  `OPENROUTER_MODEL` and left the rotation behind it; one run had
  `minimax/minimax-m3` fail **223 of 1,200** calls, so mistral answered them and
  the board had to declare the arm impure. With an arm of one that cannot
  happen — and `rotations` survives as a *guard* that says **THE PINNING
  FAILED** if it is ever non-zero.
- **Clean latency.** A retried call's wall clock is the failed attempt plus the
  one that worked.
- **Flakiness is a failure count with its error classes**, which says *why* — a
  local model that will not honour a schema fails differently from a provider
  that timed out.

Latency is `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` (a wall clock can step backwards under NTP, and a
negative latency is unreadable), taken around the whole `#classify` — the schema
build and the resolution back to records included, both microseconds beside a
round trip. **A failed call carries no latency**, deliberately: how long it took
to fail is a fact about the failure.

### Cold start, and why the latencies are warm-cache figures

A local model pays a load cost of seconds to tens of seconds on its first call,
and **ollama unloads it again after about five minutes idle** and may evict one
when another is loaded. So:

- **Every arm gets one warm call before its first pass**, timed and reported as
  `first call`, and **excluded from the median and the p95.** For a local model
  that number is mostly the model being read into memory; for a hosted one it
  makes the first-call outlier visible as its own figure instead of hidden in
  the band.
- **Repetitions run contiguously and models are never interleaved** — the loop
  is arms outside, reps inside — so a local model answers the whole corpus four
  times over without another model being loaded in between.
- **`Arm#keep_resident!` pins it for 45 minutes through the daemon's own
  `/api/generate`**, out of band, so the app's calls stay ordinary calls.
  `RubyLLM::Chat#with_params` would carry `keep_alive`, but `BaseAgent` does not
  expose it and reaching through `agent.chat` to set a provider parameter would
  be the instrument reconfiguring the app's own call. Whether the daemon
  accepted is printed (`resident` / `refused` / `unreachable`).
- **The cold start is reported and never judged.** It is one observation per arm
  per set, and `Eval::Noise` needs `MIN_RUNS` of anything before it will speak.

So **every latency on the board is a warm-cache figure**, and the board says so
in its own header.

### Concurrency, and what it does to the latency figures

**A pass runs `CONCURRENCY=` of its lines at once, eight by default.** 98% of a
pass is the model round trip — 185 of the 192 seconds of a 300-line pass, with
the seed loads, the `Chat` and `Message` writes and the closed-set queries
together under seven — so the pass is network-bound and the speedup is very
nearly N. Measured on `mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1`:

| in flight | throughput | speedup | median latency | p95 | failures |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (serial) | 103.6 calls/min | 1.00× | 0.541s | 0.831s | 0 |
| 2 | 206.1 | 1.99× | 0.563s | 0.724s | 0 |
| 4 | 418.1 | **4.04×** | 0.538s | 0.767s | 0 |
| 8 | 745.4 | **7.20×** | 0.565s (+4%) | 0.870s | 0 |
| 16 | 1095.0 | 10.57× | 0.651s (+20%) | 1.286s | 0 |
| 32 | 981.0 | 9.47× | **1.453s (+169%)** | 3.020s | 0 |

**Past about sixteen the provider stops answering faster and starts queueing**:
throughput falls and the measured latency becomes queueing time rather than
model speed. OpenRouter returns no `x-ratelimit-*` and no `retry-after` on a
completion and, at 32 in flight, returned **zero 429s** — it simply answered
more slowly. So queueing time cannot be separated from service time by this
client, and the only honest instrument is **the recorded concurrency plus this
table**. Eight is the last point where the latency columns still say what they
mean; that is `Eval::Concurrency::ADVISED_MAX`, and above it the run prints a
warning rather than refusing.

**What concurrency does NOT move: the answers.** Sequential against eight in
flight, on the same lines and the same positions, 40 of 40 answers were
identical. So the accuracies, the closed-set misses, the `also_named` figures
and the refusal agreement are comparable across concurrencies and **only
`latency_median` and `latency_p95` are not.** That is exactly what the set
records and what a comparison enforces:

- `Result#concurrency` is written into every set; a set written before it —
  including **every baseline checked in under `db/eval`, all of them taken
  serially** — reads as `1`.
- `rake eval:classifier_board` prints it as its own row, beside the two latency
  rows it qualifies.
- `rake eval:classifier_compare` warns loudly on a mismatch **and drops the two
  latency verdicts entirely**. A serial before against a concurrent after would
  otherwise hand back REAL and BETTER on `latency_median` for a change that is
  a fact about the harness. To compare speed, re-run one side at the other's
  concurrency.

**A local arm is always serial**, whatever `CONCURRENCY=` says. It is one
CPU-only ollama daemon answering one call at a time, so concurrency there does
not overlap anything — it queues, and reports the queueing as the model's
latency, which is the one figure a local arm exists to produce.

**Two arms never run at once in one process**, and the bench refuses rather
than measures if asked. `Arm#pinned` rewrites `BaseAgent.default_model_options`
as a singleton method on the class — process-global by design, because
`BaseAgent` is the one gate every call goes through — and two arms pinned at
once answer as each other's model. The `rotations` guard cannot catch it,
because it reads the same corrupted `BaseAgent`. Arms in parallel would mean one
process and one SQLite file per arm, the way `eval:run` already spawns its
prose runs; that is not built.

**Mechanically, the safety is one pinned connection.**
`Eval::Concurrency.rolled_back` uses
`ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.pin_connection!(true)` with
`unpin_connection!` in an `ensure`. Pinning installs an
`ActiveSupport::Concurrency::ThreadMonitor`, so every statement and every
savepoint runs under one mutex — the database work is serialised, which is what
one SQLite handle and one shared transaction stack need and which costs nothing
at 3.6% of the pass — while the HTTP round trip runs outside it. It **replaces**
`ActiveRecord::Base.transaction` and is never nested inside one:
`within_new_transaction` holds the connection lock for the whole duration of its
block, so a worker inside one deadlocks on its first statement, reproducibly and
immediately.

### A 429 is a failure, not a slow success

**`RubyLLM.config.max_retries` is set to 0 for the length of a bench run**, and
restored afterwards. This is a correctness fix to the existing latency and
failure columns and is worth having whether or not a pass ever runs concurrently.

`RubyLLM::Connection#setup_retry` installs `faraday-retry` with
`RubyLLM::RateLimitError` among its retriable exceptions, and this app leaves
the defaults in place: three retries at roughly 0.1s, 0.2s and 0.4s with jitter.
That is right for a **player** — a turn that quietly survives a 429 is a turn
nobody had to retype — and wrong for an **instrument**, because every one of
those retries happens inside `BaseAgent#ask`, which is inside the
`CLOCK_MONOTONIC` window the bench measures. A rate-limited call was therefore
reported as a *slow success*: not in `failures`, not in `failures_by_class`, and
silently inflating the median it was measuring. It also contradicted `Arm`'s own
rule — *flakiness is a failure count, not a retry count.*

With the retries off: a 429 is a failed call carrying `RubyLLM::RateLimitError`,
the latency covers only calls that answered first time, and **the failure column
becomes the pacing signal** — a run whose failures rise with N is a run whose N
is too high.

### A local model, and the reasoning block in front of the answer

**There is no local bench set: this machine is not powerful enough to run
one.** What is below is a handful of spot
single-call measurements and the machinery that makes the run possible later on
hardware that can carry it. Read every figure here as one call, not as a bench
result — a bench result is four repetitions of the whole corpus with a band, and none
was taken.

Two things had to be measured before a local arm would have been a measurement
of the classifier at all, and they are worth keeping written down because they
are what a later run on better hardware needs to know.

**The machine is CPU-only.** `/api/ps` reports `size_vram: 0` for every loaded
model, so every figure below is a CPU figure and none of them transfers to a
box with a working GPU driver. It has 19 GB of RAM, and one 6 GB model resident
beside a running pass put it into swap.

**And a thinking model thinks before it answers, even under a schema.** RubyLLM
reaches ollama through its **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint —
`config.ollama_api_base` ends in `/v1` — which returns the reasoning in a field
of its own beside the answer. The schema constrains the *content*; the thinking
happens in front of it. Warm `qwen3:4b`, the app's own prompt and schema, one
call each:

| request says | wall clock | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nothing | 100.2s | a `reasoning` field comes back beside 23 tokens of answer |
| `think: false` | 100.7s | **ignored** — an ollama-native field, and `/v1` is not it |
| `chat_template_kwargs: {enable_thinking: false}` | 100.0s | **ignored** |
| `reasoning_effort: "low"` | 100.2s | honoured, and low is not none |
| `reasoning_effort: "none"` | **2.1s** | no reasoning field, same correct answer |

So it is **`reasoning_effort`, a standard OpenAI field**, and not ollama's own
`think`. A 48-fold difference on the one call a player waits for, and the same
23 tokens of answer either way. (For the record, the native `/api/chat` endpoint
with `format:` and `think: false` answers the same call in 1.95s. The app does
not speak it, so neither does the bench — an instrument reaching past the app's
own client would be measuring a different client.)

**How the bench asks.** A spec may carry a `+nothink` suffix —
`MODELS=ollama:qwen3:4b+nothink` — and that arm, and only that arm, gets
`reasoning_effort: "none"`. It reaches the call through
`BaseAgent.default_provider_params`, **a seam that is empty in every shipped
path** and pinned empty by `BaseAgent::ProviderParamsTest`: an ordinary agent's
chat is never handed `with_params` at all. `Arm#pinned` replaces it for the
length of one pass and restores it in an `ensure`, exactly as it does the model
options. It is refused for a hosted arm.

**It is never inferred, and the app as shipped would run qwen3 with thinking
ON.** An arm that does not ask measures the model the way this app would really
use it, which is the 100-second figure — and *that is the finding*, not a
footnote to it. Making the app fast on ollama is a change to the app, to be
decided on its own evidence; the seam is a measurement asking a question. Two
arms of one model with the thinking on and off are two rows on the board.

**The spot figures, all warm, all one call each.** Stated as what they are:

| model | one warm call | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `qwen3:4b` no thinking | **3.0s** | and >120s with thinking on |
| `qwen3:8b` no thinking | **7.2s** | cold load 60.9s |
| `gemma3:12b` | **no answer in 600s** | cold and warm alike; it has no thinking mode to turn off, so there is nothing to try next |

`gemma3:12b` is recorded as **unmeasurable on this machine** rather than as a bad
score, and the other two are recorded as unmeasured rather than as absent. The
arm selector, the latency machinery and the seam are all in and green, so
`MODELS=ollama:qwen3:4b+nothink REPS=4` is one command away on a machine that
can carry it.

### The baseline of 2026-09-04 — four hosted models, 4,800 calls

**These three sets are checked in**, under `db/eval/`, and this table is printed
from them: `rake eval:classifier_board` with no arguments reads them on any
machine, with no key, no network and no database. So the table below and the
files agree by construction, and a later run can be given a real REAL / NOISE
verdict against today's numbers rather than against a paragraph.

```bash
rake eval:classifier_board                              # today's baseline, from db/eval
rake eval:classifier SET=after-a-prompt-change          # your run, into tmp/eval
rake eval:classifier_compare BEFORE=classifier-remote AFTER=after-a-prompt-change \
    BEFORE_MODEL=mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1 AFTER_MODEL=mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
```

Three sets, printed as one table by `rake eval:classifier_board`. **They
measured the 300-line corpus of 2026-09-04**, which combat slice 8 then grew to
339 — so a compare against one of them prints the different-digest warning, and
what moved may be the labelled lines rather than the classifier. 300 lines × 4
reps an arm; every rate `min..max (median)` across repetitions, never pooled. A
single number means the four repetitions agreed exactly.

| figure | `mistral-medium-3.1` | `minimax-m3` | `mistral-small-3.2-24b` | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| set | `classifier-remote` | `classifier-remote` | `classifier-mistral-small` | `classifier-gemini-flash-lite` |
| `strict_accuracy` | **0.939..0.951 (0.947)** | 0.905..0.938 (0.918) | 0.872..0.877 (0.875) | 0.898 |
| `accuracy` | **0.943..0.953 (0.950)** | 0.906..0.936 (0.918) | 0.857..0.866 (0.861) | 0.913 |
| `intent_accuracy` | **0.980..0.983 (0.980)** | 0.966..0.977 (0.973) | 0.962..0.973 (0.967) | 0.950 |
| `refusal_agreement` | **0.951..0.959 (0.955)** | 0.946..0.971 (0.949) | 0.893..0.902 (0.896) | 0.931 |
| `closed_set_misses` | **8..11 (9.5)** | 11..18 (17) | 30..32 (30.5) | 11 |
| `also_named` precision | **1.000** | 0.788 | 0.553 | **1.000** |
| `also_named` recall | 0.888 | 0.897 | **0.948** | 0.862 |
| omission rate | **0.000** | **0.000** | **0.000** | **0.000** |
| latency median (warm) | 0.61s | **0.44s** | 0.92s | 0.53s |
| latency p95 (warm) | 0.88s | 1.83s | 3.23s | **0.64s** |
| cost per 1,000 calls | $0.19 | $0.14 | **$0.03** | $0.05 |
| failed calls | **0** | 1..3 (1.5) | 1..24 (7) | **0** |
| rotations | 0 of 1200 | 0 of 1200 | 0 of 1200 | 0 of 1200 |

**`also_named` is a precision/recall trade and the four sit all over it.**
`mistral-medium` and `gemini-flash-lite` miss a second name (the engine plays
half a line); `minimax` invents one 28 times in 132; `mistral-small` invents one
**89 times in 199**, and each of those is a refusal the player reads for no
reason. The shipped first model gets the safe
direction.

**Read `latency_p95` beside `latency_median`, because they do not rank the same
way.** `minimax-m3` has the fastest median of the four and the second-worst p95:
one line in twenty costs four times the typical line. `gemini-flash-lite` is the
only arm whose p95 stays inside a second.

**`gemini-2.5-flash-lite` returned the identical figure on all four
repetitions** — 274 of 300, 11 closed-set misses, every time. A band of zero,
which makes it the most sensitive arm a later prompt change could be judged
against: any movement at all is movement.

**The cheapest arm is not cheap.** `mistral-small-3.2` costs a sixth of
`mistral-medium` and returns **three times the closed-set misses**, on the one
call whose answer moves a row.

**Failures are stated, never hidden, and the flakiness ranking is not the
accuracy ranking.** `minimax-m3` is the only arm that failed the SCHEMA (7 of
1,200 `BaseAgent::SchemaIgnoredError`; an earlier run of this same bench had
**223 of 1,200**). `mistral-small-3.2` failed 39 of 1,200 and none of them on
schema — 27 rate-limit, 12 transport, 24 of them inside one repetition, which is
why its own band on `failures` is 1..24. An arm of one cannot retry, so every
one of those is a counted, attributed failure rather than a call some other
model quietly answered.

**Reproducibility, incidentally.** `classifier-remote` re-measured
`mistral-medium-3.1` on a different day and a different base from the first
1,200-call baseline: 0.939..0.943 (0.941) then, 0.939..0.951 (0.947) now.
Overlapping bands, independent runs.

### The set, and comparing two of them after the fact

**Every classifier bench run is a named set with a durable scores artifact.**
The set records which model produced it, and comparisons work from the stored
scores alone.

Same convention as the prose loop. `SET=<name>`, defaulting to
`classifier-<timestamp>`; the durable artifact is
**`tmp/eval/<set>/classifier.json`**, beside the `scores.json` an `eval:run` set
writes.

**Two places a set is read from, in this order:** `tmp/eval/<set>` first, then
**`db/eval/<set>`** — the checked-in baseline. A run you just paid for therefore
wins over one the repo ships under the same name, which is the less surprising of
the two possible surprises; nothing writes to `db/eval` except a person deciding
to keep a set. `Eval.set_path` is the one place that order lives, and
`Eval::Classifier::KeptSetsTest` pins it.

**A kept set is a SUMMARY, and that is deliberate.** A whole set is 1.1 MB a
model because it keeps every reading — right for `tmp/eval`, where a rate can be
redefined and recomputed without paying for the calls again, and wrong for a file
in the repo. `Result#summary` drops the rows and keeps every pass's figures plus
the four `also_named` counts and the answered count, which is exactly what
`eval:classifier_board` and `eval:classifier_compare` read: **12 KB for the whole
baseline against 4.4 MB, rendering a byte-identical table.** What it gives up is
stated rather than discovered later — the MISSED list, the per-shape and
per-intent breakdowns, and any figure not already computed. Those live in the
run's own output.

```bash
# keeping a set, which is a decision and not a side effect of running one
bin/rails runner 'Eval::Classifier::Result.load(Eval.root.join("my-set")) \
  .summary.write!(Eval.kept_root.join("my-set"), name: "my-set")'
``` It is `classifier.json` and not `scores.json` because one set can
legitimately hold both a prose run and a bench, and two files of one name
cannot.

The file holds **every reading of every pass**, not just the rates, so a change
to how a rate is defined does not need the calls paid for again — the same rule
that keeps the prose loop's run databases. It records:

| field | why |
| --- | --- |
| `arms` | **which models the set measured.** The field the cross-model comparison pairs on |
| `answered_by` | the models that *really* answered, read back off the readings — different from `arms` when the rotation answered a line |
| `corpus_digest` | a fingerprint of the labelled lines. Two sets scored on different corpora are not comparable, and a mismatch is **warned about above the verdicts** rather than reported as a change in the model |
| `reps`, `corpus_size` | the shape of the run |

**Comparing two models** works off those files alone:

```bash
rake eval:classifier SET=arm-mistral MODELS=mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
rake eval:classifier SET=arm-minimax MODELS=minimax/minimax-m3
rake eval:classifier_compare BEFORE=arm-mistral AFTER=arm-minimax
```

**Every set on disk as one table** — the cross-model comparison and the check
on this whole convention, because it reads
`tmp/eval/<set>/classifier.json` and nothing else. No database, no key, no
corpus:

```bash
rake eval:classifier_board                      # every set it can find
rake eval:classifier_board SETS=arm-mistral,arm-minimax
```

One column per **arm**, not per set: the hosted pair is measured in one run and
a local model needs a set to itself (its repetitions have to be contiguous). It
prints in markdown, because a cross-model table is read in a PR body rather than
a terminal, and it **gives no verdicts** — a band is printed and overlapping
bands are visible, but REAL / NOISE / INCONCLUSIVE is `Eval::Noise`'s to say,
two arms at a time, with the digests checked. A figure a set never recorded
reads **`not recorded`** and never as a zero; the first baseline predates the
latency machinery, and a table that printed `0.00s` for it would have invented a
fast model out of a missing field.

With **no model in common and one a side**, the two are paired and the board
says loudly that it is comparing two *different models* rather than two versions
of one. With models in common, each is compared against itself — the ordinary
before/after of a prompt change. With nothing in common and several a side it
**refuses rather than guessing**, and names `BEFORE_MODEL=` / `AFTER_MODEL=`;
those also pick one arm out of a two-model set on either side.

### While it runs

A bench run holds **one write transaction per pass** — a pass being one model's
one repetition of the corpus, a few minutes — against a copy of each seeded
world loaded under a title of its own and rolled back at the end. So it is safe
against a database somebody is mid-game in, exactly as `rake game:sweep` is, but
SQLite gives one writer at a time: **while a pass is open, another writing task
in the next terminal (`rake game:sweep`, a browser turn) will wait and may fail
with `database is locked`.** Run one at a time.

### The offline floor

`rake eval:classifier_offline` runs the same 339 lines through
`Playthrough::Grammar`, the fixed grammar `Playthrough::Mechanics` uses with
`model: false` — no key, no network, no spend, and it runs in `bin/rails test`.
**It is what a classifier call is bought against**, and the answer is a number
rather than an assumption.

Five outcomes, told apart: `resolved`, `refused` (right refusal, possibly the
wrong reason — the grammar has no refusal *kinds*), `wrong` (an answer the label
does not accept, produced silently), `over_refused` (a line it refused that
should have played) and `unparsed`.

**Measured 2026-09-05: 140 of 339 right (0.413), and 178 of the 199 failures are
over-refusals** (127 of 300, 0.423, on the pre-slice-8 corpus). It gets every
reach-that-finds-nothing right — including an attack that finds nobody — and *none* of the
`other` or `examine-nothing` lines — a fixed grammar has no word for an ordinary
remark, so it refuses every one.

**And since `ta-slash-input` this floor is no longer only a fallback**, because
the browser reads a slashed or verb-first line with the same grammar before it
spends a call. The floor is unaffected by that and stays byte-identical: it
reaches `Playthrough::Grammar#parse`, while what the browser is ALLOWED to take
is decided one level up in `#reading_first`, which takes only a reading that
RESOLVED a record and defers a line still joining two things together
(`JOINING_WORDS`). **The two numbers are different questions and both are worth
having**: this one is what the grammar CAN do, and the one below is what the
loop actually takes of it.

| through `#reading_first`, every line in slash form | n |
| --- | --- |
| resolves offline, and the label accepts it | **65 of 339 (19.2%)** |
| resolves offline, and the label does not | **0** |
| falls back to `Playthrough::Classifier` | 274 of 339 (80.8%) |

**Typed as they stand, with no slash: 0 of 339.** Only slash-prefixed commands
are accepted by the offline reader, so nothing changes for a player who never
types one. By shape the slashed
form answers `move` 20/42,
`take` 13/23, `articles-and-pronouns` 10/27, `talk` 7/54, `attack` 6/16, `examine` 5/17 and
`drop` 4/18 — and **nothing at all** of `other`, `examine-nothing`, `two-sets`,
`two-names-one-set` or any `unresolved-*`, every one of which is a line the model
is bought for. Re-take it with `Playthrough::Grammar#reading_first` over
`Eval::Classifier.corpus` if the verb table or the guard ever changes.

### The `also_named` omission rate

PR 102's review finding **F4**: `also_named` is a **required** field on the
commonest model call in the app, and the worry was that a provider would send it
missing or null. Neither the resolved `Intent` nor a rate over it can tell an
omitted field from an answer of `nothing`, so the bench reads the provider's own
stored JSON through `Message#structured_content` and counts.

It is reported on every bench run at no extra cost, over every call the run
already paid for. `rake eval:classifier_omission` is the targeted probe — the
~30 two-noun lines alone, for a fraction of a cent — for re-checking it on its
own.

**The claim being checked is that a truly absent field is a *failed call*:**
`BaseAgent#missing_schema_keys` rotates on it, so an omission shows up as a
rotation or a failure and never as a quiet nil.

### What it is not

**It does not tune a prompt.** A prompt fitted against the run that measured it
is a prompt fitted to the corpus. The bench is the instrument;
`rake eval:classifier_compare` is how the next change is judged, and four
repetitions a side is the same arithmetic floor as everywhere else in this file.

There is **no held-out half**, and that is a difference from the prose loop
rather than an oversight: holding `The Salt Assizes` out is about not tuning
narration checks on prose nobody has read, and a labelled line is not prose
anybody tuned a check on. All three worlds are in the corpus.

### When to re-run the bench

**Free and automatic, on every `bin/rails test`**: the corpus validator
(`Eval::Classifier::Corpus#problems`, `Eval::Classifier::CorpusTest`) and the
offline grammar floor (`rake eval:classifier_offline`, asserted in
`Eval::Classifier::OfflineTest` between a floor and a ceiling rather than at a
number). Neither makes a model call, and between them they catch a change to
the fixed grammar, to the seeded worlds, or to the item and character layers —
the labels are checked back against the closed sets the actions really read.
That is not theoretical: **the PR 117 item-layer rebase made items
per-playthrough, position staging stopped snapshotting, and the validator
failed the build** rather than the bench quietly measuring empty floors.

**Re-run the paid hosted arms before merging** when any of these change. A pass
is 339 lines × `REPS=4` = 1,356 calls an arm, at 372 tokens in and 20 out
(`Eval::Classifier::PER_CALL`): **$0.19 per 1,000 calls on
`mistral-medium-3.1`, $0.14 on `minimax-m3`, so both shipped models at the
default is about $0.44** — the 300-line `classifier-remote` set cost $0.389 and
the 339-line slice 8 pair cost $0.389 and $0.440.

1. **The prompt.** The classifier's instructions (the engine's
   `data/playthrough/classifier.yml`) or
   `Playthrough::IntentSchema` — any wording, the `also_named` paragraph, a new
   intent. This is the reason the bench exists, and a prompt-shaped change
   lands with a BEFORE/AFTER `rake eval:classifier_compare` verdict in its PR
   body.
2. **What the model is shown.** `Playthrough::Classifier#offered_for`,
   `#command_prompt`, the exit, people, item or nickname listing, anything
   passed beside the line. A change in *which* lines reach the model — a
   grammar-first router, say — does not change the prompt but does change the
   population the model still answers, and earns one measurement after it
   lands.
   *`ta-slash-input` is the worked example of (2), and it is here because the
   answer was "no paid re-run".* The router it added sends a line to
   `Playthrough::Grammar` instead of the model **only when the player prefixes
   it with `/`**. Every line typed without
   one still reaches the classifier: **0 of the 300 corpus lines change hands as
   they stand**, so the population the hosted arms were measured on is unchanged
   and the checked-in sets still describe this code. What is owed is a
   measurement of the *slashed* population once players type slashes — which
   cannot be taken until there are any.
3. **The model or its settings.** `BaseAgent::REMOTE_MODEL_IDS` or its order,
   `TEMPERATURE`, provider params, any RubyLLM/OpenRouter plumbing in
   `BaseAgent` that touches the call.
4. **The corpus.** A new verb or input shape should add cases; `corpus_digest`
   then changes, older sets stop being comparable (the comparison warns above
   its verdicts), and a new committed baseline under `db/eval/` is taken.

**On a schedule — monthly, and before any release — as a vendor-drift canary.**
A hosted model changes under the same name with no notice, and nothing in this
repo would say so. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` is the arm to watch: it returned
274 of 300 on **all four repetitions**, a band of zero, so any movement at all
is movement.

**And when real play says so.** A rise in refusals, drift or overreach in the
database or in `Playthrough::Feedback` verdicts is a symptom with several
possible causes; the bench is the only thing that says whether the classifier
is one of them.

**No re-run is needed** for a narrator prompt change (a different call, and the
prose loop's job), for UI work, or for engine mechanics that leave the closed
sets alone.

---

## The prompt bench

The classifier bench measures the call the engine ACTS on. This measures the
call the player READS, and it is the instrument the standing rule requires:
**no narration or prompt change lands until there is a testing method for it.**

Until now the only way to judge a prompt-shaped change was `rake eval:run` —
twenty-turn scripted runs across three worlds, dollars a comparison, four runs a
side before `Eval::Noise` will say anything, and every figure entangled with
which rooms the script happened to walk through. This asks for **one turn at a
time against fixed facts**, so a difference between two sets is a difference in
the prose and nothing else.

```bash
rake eval:prompt                        # 90 cases x 4 reps x 1 model, ~$0.20
rake eval:prompt_score SET=name         # score a stored set again -- offline, free, no key
rake eval:prompt_compare BEFORE=a AFTER=b
rake eval:prompt_board                  # every stored set as one table
```

| knob | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `REPS=4` | repetitions. **Four is the default because four is `Eval::Noise::MIN_RUNS`** — a run taken at the default can actually be judged later |
| `MODELS=a,b` | **the arm selector**, `Eval::Classifier::Arm` and not a second one. Defaults to ONE model — `BaseAgent::REMOTE_MODEL_IDS.first`, which is what a player's turn is written by — because a prompt change is judged on the model that ships |
| `SET=name` | where the numbers land (`tmp/eval/<set>/prompt.json`). Defaults to a timestamp |
| `SAMPLE=12` | how many flagged cases the board prints in full |
| `YES=1` | spend past the $1.00 ceiling |

### How a case works

A case is **a position and one turn**. The position is a seeded world, a room,
and the typed lines that walk to the state the case is written against; the turn
is what was typed and the action the classifier would have resolved it to.

**Everything else is the game's.** The engine plays the turn whole with ONE
thing replaced — the classifier's reading — so the branch, the row that moves,
the fact sentence and the moment are the ones a player gets. The
classifier is the thing replaced because it is the only call in a turn that is
not being measured: leaving it in would put a second model between the case and
the passage.

**One model call a case, and the corpus validator is what keeps it that way.** A
stub destination would call `Location::Generator`, a readable thing with no words
yet would call `Item::Inscriber` on the first repetition only, and a `talk` costs
two calls. All three are refused at validation; `calls` counts what really
happened and the board says so if it was ever more than one.

**Its own copy of the world per case**, through `Eval::Classifier::Stage.open` —
the classifier bench's staging seam, called rather than copied, so there is one
place to fix when it changes. A case moves rows, so two cases sharing one staged
position would not be two cases. It is also the shortest write transaction
either bench takes: one call, against a database somebody may be mid-game in.

### The corpus

`test/fixtures/files/prompt_corpus.yml` — **90 hand-verified cases across 10
positions in two seeded worlds**, and the typed lines are real: the 76 typed
turns in the development database, the 119 take and drop turns of
`transition_corpus.json`, and the `rake eval:run` scripts.

`The Lunar Cartographer` is **excluded** and the reason is mechanical:
`WorldMechanic::ShuffleConnections` repoints its doorways on the story's clock,
so the exits in its prompts would depend on when the case was played. Its rooms
are all stubs besides.

| shape | cases | what it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `take` | 18 | `take_denied` — the defect this bench was built for |
| `drop` | 18 | `pickup_invented` |
| `read` | 14 | `inscription_misquoted`, on the three items whose words are on record |
| `examine` | 10 | a look at a thing with nothing written on it — the control for `read` |
| `other` | 18 | the loosest prompt in the game, and the one most likely to invent |
| `move` | 12 | the ARRIVAL pass (`Scene::Generator`), which is schema'd and has its own instructions |

**How the cases are verified.** `Eval::Prompt::Corpus#problems` stages every
position and checks each case against the closed set its action really reads
(`Playthrough::Classifier#offered_for`), exactly as the classifier corpus is
checked, and `Eval::Prompt::CorpusTest` fails the build on a case that does not
fit, that the engine would refuse rather than narrate, or that would buy a second
model call. What it cannot check is whether a case is worth measuring — that is
the hand-verification, and every case carries a `why`.

### What it measures

Eight of the twelve `Story::Scoreboard` checks run, over the passage that came
back and the facts the case supplied. **The other four are UNAVAILABLE and are
never scored as clean** — a zero for any of them would be the most dangerous
number this instrument could print:

| check | why one turn cannot answer it |
| --- | --- |
| `unreachable_transition` | a case is one turn, and the one turn that moves walks an edge the records have |
| `reached_for_nothing` | a drift row needs the turn AFTER the narration |
| `named_more_than_one` | a case types a fixed line, so what it named measures the corpus |
| `still_run` | four turns of nothing needs four turns |

Beside the rates, and never folded into them: **richness** (`Eval::Richness`,
read out of the same stored facts) and **what a stored passage cannot show** —
refusals (`BaseAgent::RefusalError`, which with an arm of one is a failed call
and not prose), failures by error class, required schema fields that came back
absent, fields that arrived at their `maxLength`, prompt and completion tokens,
latency median and p95 **warm** with the first call excluded, and spend.

**Tuning and held out are printed apart and labelled**, exactly as `Eval::Board`
prints them, and it matters more here than anywhere: this bench exists so a
prompt can be tuned against a measurement, and a prompt tuned against every case
in the file is a prompt fitted to the file. Tune on `The Unrecorded Hour`, read
the result on `The Salt Assizes`.

### The prompt version, and what a matching digest means

A prose prompt is instructions and facts interleaved, so there are **two
digests** and they cover different amounts:

- **`instructions_digest`** — the system message: the narrator's instructions
  for a narrated turn, `Scene::Generator#system_prompt` for an arrival. It is
  `Playthrough::PromptVersion.narration_instructions`, and it covers the
  instruction block and nothing else. What `Playthrough::Feedback` freezes on a
  verdict is the WIDER `Playthrough::PromptVersion.narration` — the instruction
  block plus the per-turn scaffold — so a bench set and the recorded verdicts
  group by the same version as far as the instructions go, and
  `prompt_digest` is what answers the rest.
- **`prompt_digest`** — **the whole prompt, byte for byte, for one designated
  case per shape** (the lowest case id of that shape). It covers everything the
  first one misses: the narrator's framing of a fact, the fact sentences,
  the `doing` line, and every fact the moment builds -- all of it the
  engine's, since every case is played by the engine. It is only meaningful because the corpus is
  fixed, which is what `corpus_digest` says.
- **`prompt_stable`** is the check on that claim: every repetition sends the
  designated case's prompt again and they are compared. A run in which one case
  sent two different prompts is a run whose facts moved, and the board says so.

**A talk turn has no instruction digest**, and that is why `talk` is not a shape
here: an exchange's narrator pass sends no system message — its prose
rules are interpolated into the per-turn user prompt with the character's name
and pronouns inside them, so a digest of it would be a digest of the cast.
`interaction-narration` prose stays measured by `rake eval:run` and
`rake game:score`, exactly as before.

### Comparing two sets

`rake eval:prompt_compare` is `Eval::Noise` again — the same exact rank test,
the same four repetitions a side. What it adds is the thing that decides whether
a verdict means anything, off the stored files alone:

- **two prompt versions on one model** — the ordinary before/after, and what
  `ta-take-drop-narration` will be judged with;
- **two models on one prompt version** — the model comparison;
- **both at once** — nothing can be attributed to either, and it says so loudly
  above the verdicts rather than leaving it to be worked out;
- **a different `corpus_digest`** — not comparable at all, and warned about the
  same way the classifier bench warns.

`commitments` is printed with **no arrow on it**. A fall in every defect rate
beside a fall in richness is prose that says less, which is the one way to
improve these numbers without improving the game.

**Two places a set is read from, in the same order as everywhere else:**
`tmp/eval/<set>` first, then `db/eval/<set>` — the checked-in baseline.
`Eval.set_path` is the one place that order lives. A kept set is a SUMMARY: the
rows are dropped and every pass's figures kept, so it is kilobytes rather than
megabytes and renders a byte-identical table.

```bash
# keeping a set, which is a decision and not a side effect of running one
bin/rails runner 'Eval::Prompt::Result.load(Eval.root.join("my-set")) \
  .summary.write!(Eval.kept_root.join("my-set"), name: "my-set")'
```

### Current kept sets and historical comparisons

**`realization-2026-10-02` is the current realization baseline.** Rooms are
furnished from their kits (`Item::Kit`) before the writer is asked anything,
and the detail prompt says what is there; each corpus case names the kind and
density its room would have been dealt. Against a before side bought at the
tree that added only those words, `things_furnished` rose to ten a room and the
writer's own things fell to about 0.4, both REAL, and every check read NOISE
(`db/eval/realization-2026-10-02/README.md`). `realization-2026-09-28` is
history from then on.

**`realization-2026-09-28` was the realization baseline before it.** The exits
call gained `kind` and `density` and the place call `place_kind`
(`Location::Kind`); no prompt message changed, and against a before side
bought the same day every figure read NOISE
(`db/eval/realization-2026-09-28/README.md`). `realization-2026-09-26` is
history from then on.

**Re-bought when every checked-in world gained an arc.** The arcs, and the
things they need on the floor, moved what the benches stage, so
`prompt-2026-09-26`, `classifier-2026-09-27`, `realization-2026-09-26`,
`inscription-2026-09-26`, `classifier-cascade-state-20260927` and
`classifier-cascade-openrouter-20260927` replace the sets named below as the
current before sides. `classifier-2026-09-27` is the request with `throw` in
the enum on the worlds with arcs; `classifier-2026-09-26` is the same worlds
before `throw`, and the two cascade sets were bought beside it, so all three
are history read at the corpus they scored; `prompt-ending-2026-09-10` and `prompt-branches-2026-09-10`
still match today's requests and were not re-bought. Three classifier labels
moved with the world -- see `db/eval/classifier-2026-09-26/README.md`, which
also has why the classifier readings were scored twice. Every set's README has
its verdict against the set it replaced; the receipts, the credit readings and
the scripts are under `doc/evidence/seed-world-arcs-rebuy/`.

`inscription-2026-10-02` and `prompt-ending-after-2026-10-02` replace
`inscription-2026-09-26` and `prompt-ending-2026-09-10` in turn. The Lunar
Cartographer's world file gained the `while_alive` ending rule, which moves
the inscription corpus digest while its requests stay byte-identical; and
the ending corpus gained a sixth case, somebody dead in the room, for the
ending's `Dead here:` line. Each set's README has its verdict and the credit
readings; the line's pair is under *The ending's own corpus* below.

`prompt-2026-09-10`, `classifier-throw-after-20260926` and
`prompt-ending-2026-09-10` were the before sides until then.
The classifier set is the judged R02 prompt with two later amendments. The
first, the `examine` criterion admitting a look at the room in general, came
back **NOISE** on every metric; its pair and verdict are in
`db/eval/classifier-examine-wording-20260918/README.md`, and that set is still
the Mistral-alone row the cascade sets were judged against. The second added
`throw` to the intent enum with a `thrown_at` field, measured on the corpus
with eight throw lines added; it came back **REAL** on strict accuracy, and its
pair and verdict are in `db/eval/classifier-throw-after-20260926/README.md`.
R02 itself prevents the demonstrated wrong-record substitutions;
`physical-classifier-final-20260914` is that run and remains history with its
own evidence directory. Older sets remain history.
The main comparison spans pre-existing request drift, so its verdicts cannot
attribute an effect to one prompt change. Recompute them with:

```bash
rake eval:prompt_compare BEFORE=prompt-2026-09-05 AFTER=prompt-2026-09-10
rake eval:classifier_compare BEFORE=classifier-examine-before-20260918 AFTER=classifier-examine-wording-20260918
rake eval:classifier_compare BEFORE=classifier-throw-before-20260926 AFTER=classifier-throw-after-20260926
rake eval:classifier_offline
rake eval:prompt_digest CORPUS=ending
```

The classifier directory also keeps its offline floor. Ending's kept
`ending_requests` records scaffold stability and completeness, every live
request, and the generated prelude fields excluded from the stable digest.
Its request identity certifies the scaffold, never identical generated prose.
`EndingVersion` documents the dependency boundary and the tests exercise it.
The generic prose checks still cannot assess whether an ending expresses its
outcome faithfully or whether its prose is good.

`desires-scale-20260920` is the current genesis baseline and was the
room-generation baseline until `realization-2026-09-26` replaced it
(scale revision of the objects of desire). `desires-realization-20260919`
remains the before side for that revision; against `physical-realization-20260910`
its behavioral checks were all noise and median output tokens rose from 22,357
to 27,885 per full pass (REAL, p=.028571).
`desires-dialogue-20260919` is the current dialogue baseline; every available
metric was noise versus `physical-dialogue-20260910`, and contradiction remains
explicitly unavailable. Both older packages remain checked-in before sides.

Task evidence and the reproducible receipt summary are under
`doc/evidence/ta-bench-rebaseline-stale/`. The task runner disables transport
retries to reserve each paid attempt against its ceiling; prompt text, schemas,
sampling parameters and scoring are unchanged. Registry-priced usage and
provider-reported charges are separate in the receipts, including warmups and
ending preludes that the legacy scored-scene totals omit.

### The baseline of 2026-09-05

**One arm, `mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1`** — `BaseAgent::REMOTE_MODEL_IDS.first`,
which is what a player's turn is actually written by — 4 repetitions, 90 cases,
**360 calls for $0.19**, checked in at `db/eval/prompt-2026-09-05`. Corpus
`dfd1756a8f1f91b8`, prompt `0ffc0228b538ac73`.

| figure | `mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1` |
| --- | --- |
| `unrecorded_departure` | 0.000..0.011 (0.000) (0..1 of 90) |
| `unrecorded_arrival` | 0.000 (0..0 of 90) |
| `item_not_held` | 0.046..0.077 (0.062) (3..5 of 65) |
| `take_denied` | **0.778..0.833 (0.778)** (14..15 of 18) |
| `pickup_invented` | 0.111 (2..2 of 18) |
| `inscription_misquoted` | 0.000 (0..0 of 43) |
| `truncated_prose` | 0.000 (0..0 of 90) |
| `third_person_protagonist` | 0.000 (0..0 of 90) |
| `words` (richness) | 92..95 (94) |
| `commitments` (richness) | 3.056..3.244 (3.111) |
| refusals / failed calls | 0 / 0 |
| omitted fields / cut at the cap | 0 / 0..1 |
| latency median / p95 (warm) | 1.41s..1.47s (1.44s) / 1.84s..2.06s (1.95s) |
| first call (cold, excluded) | 1.9s |
| cost per 1,000 narrations | $1.18 |
| rotations | 0 of 360 |

**`take_denied` at 0.778 is the defect `ta-take-drop-narration` exists to fix**,
reproduced here for a fifth of a dollar where it previously took a 480-turn
sweep and a person reading for twenty minutes to find. It reads on the held-out
world too — 14 of 16 there, 43 of 56 in the tuning world — so a fix that only
works on the world it was tuned against will show.

The passages are not subtle:

```
take-daybook-plain    "pick up your daybook"
                      -> "You already hold the daybook, its weight familiar in your hands."
take-slate-plain      "pick up the Assize tide-slate"          [HELD OUT]
                      -> "You already hold the Assize tide-slate, its weight familiar in your palm."
drop-slate-plain      "put the Assize tide-slate down on the bench"   [HELD OUT]
                      -> "You lift the Assize tide-slate from where it leans against the wall
                          and carry it to the Justicar's bench."
```

**Everything else is at or near zero**, which is worth stating rather than
celebrating: on a single turn with the facts in front of it this model does not
truncate, does not write the player in the third person, does not walk them into
another room and does not misquote an inscription. `item_not_held` at 0.062 is
the only other live rate, and every flag is a passage lifting something off a
floor the player is standing on.

### The ending's own corpus, and the baseline of 2026-09-08

`test/fixtures/files/prompt_ending_corpus.yml` — **five cases across three
positions in `The Iron Gate Descends`**, the one world in the repository with an
arc. It is a **second file** for one reason: `Eval::Prompt.digest` is over the
cases, so a case added to `prompt_corpus.yml` would cost the 2026-09-05 baseline
its standing as a before side. Two files, two digests, two kept sets;
`rake eval:prompt CORPUS=ending` plays this one.

**How a case gets one beat from the end.** `Eval::Classifier::Stage` walks each
position's `setup:` lines through the real engine with no model, so the beats
they reach are reached by `Playthrough::Arc` exactly as a player's lines would
reach them; the `room:` is then set as a column, with no turn and no `Scene`,
which is what lets a position STAND in the last beat's room without having
reached it. The validator refuses a case that is not **exactly one beat** from
the end, or whose setup already finished the arc
(`Eval::Prompt::Corpus#ending_problems`). Two of the three positions reach the
default ending and one reaches `too-late`, because the engine selects it off
`playthrough_beats` — so the corpus measures *the ending the ENGINE chose is the
ending the narrator was told*, not only the prose.

**Each case buys two calls**: an ending happens on the turn AFTER a line the
engine played, so the take, look or arrival is narrated first and the ending
second. The scored passage is the ending — the last `Scene` the turn wrote.

**Both sides are checked in and were RE-BOUGHT on 2026-09-08**
(`db/eval/prompt-ending-before-2026-09-08-2`, `…-after-…-2`), 4 reps, one arm,
**40 calls a side for $0.0111 + $0.0094 = $0.0205 the pair**, so the verdict
below replays offline and free with

```bash
rake eval:prompt_compare BEFORE=prompt-ending-before-2026-09-08-2 AFTER=prompt-ending-after-2026-09-08-2
```

**WHY THERE ARE TWO PAIRS ON DISK, because this is the case the protocol did not
have an answer for until it happened.** The pair PR 162 bought read
`item_not_held` 0.000 → 0.200 REAL, and the diagnosis was the CHECK:
`Story::Audit::Prose.item_names` aliased `iron key` to **iron**, a word of this
world's central place, the IRON GATE. PR 164 fixed that — an item's alias is its
own last word and never an earlier one. But **a kept set is a summary and holds
no prose** (`Eval::Prompt::Result#summary` drops the readings so the pair can
live in the repo), so `rake eval:prompt_score` reprints the rates that were
computed while the calls were being paid for and *cannot recompute them*. A
check fix therefore cannot re-score the figure it invalidated — it can only be
re-bought, which is why the `-2` pair exists. The
2026-09-08 pair stays on disk as history and stays in `Eval::MEASUREMENT_FILES`;
`Eval::Prompt::EndingKeptSetTest` is what labels it as history and asserts that
both after sides sent byte-identical `ending` instructions, so the only
difference between the pairs is the check.

**The lesson for the next kept set**: a rate you may later want to re-score is
only re-scorable from a corpus that carries its passages — `whole_run_corpus.json`
and `rake game:score` do, a kept prompt set does not.

**The two sides score DIFFERENT PASSAGES of the same turn**, and every figure
has to be read knowing it: before the change there was no ending prose at all,
so the before side scored the turn's own paragraph. `words` 87 → 51 is a closing
paragraph measured against a take or a look, not a paragraph that got shorter;
`commitments` 1.500 → 2.600 is the figure that reads across, and the ending
names more of the records than the prose it follows.

| figure | before | after | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `item_not_held` | 0.000 | 0.100 | **NOISE** — the band spans zero; the aliasing check called this same comparison REAL |
| every other check | 0.000 | 0.000 | NOISE |
| refusals, failures, cap hits | 0 | 0 | NOISE |
| `words` (richness) | 87 | 51 | reported |
| `commitments` (richness) | 1.500 | 2.600 | reported |
| latency median (warm) | 1.84s | 3.20s | WORSE, REAL — the second call of the turn |

**Nothing flagged at all on the before side, and no check REAL on either.** That
is the whole result of the re-buy: the one rate that made the original verdict
look like a regression was the check, and with the check fixed the ending pass
costs a second call and buys more commitments without moving a single defect
rate out of noise.

**The after side records `prompt_stable: false`, and it is the only set in the
repository that does.** The ending prompt carries `What just happened:`, which on
this pass is the prose the FIRST call of the same turn wrote — so the designated
case's whole prompt differs between repetitions by construction, and
`Eval::Prompt::Version` says so rather than hiding it. The facts the engine owns
in that prompt are as fixed as any other case's.

**The residual 0.100 was a SECOND false-positive class in the same check, found
by the re-buy and since fixed in the check.** Both flagged passages put the iron
key *in the mud* — *"the prince's signet ring heavy in your grip, the iron key
discarded in the mud beside his stiffened corpse"* — and the check fired because
a true claim about the RING preceded the key in the same clause list, so the
possession window carried the first item's claim across the comma onto the
second. `Story::Audit#possession_claimed?` now ends that window at a comma when
a noun phrase already stands before the place phrase in its own clause, and no
longer reads a possession verb straight after `your` ("your grip") as a verb;
`Eval::Prompt::EndingKeptSetTest` holds the sentence as the regression.

**The kept 0.100 does not move, and cannot:** a kept set holds no prose, so the
after side's `item_not_held` is what the check read before this fix — history,
like the 2026-09-08 pair's 0.200. The verdict it feeds was already NOISE, so
nothing is re-bought for it. Every corpus that carries its passages re-scored
unchanged.

### The sixth case, and the pair of 2026-10-02

The ending is told who lies dead in its room (`Dead here: <name> (<nickname>).
They cannot speak or act.`), on the ending's pass alone, because a game of The
Lunar Cartographer closed on a dead man "standing motionless over the rope":
the room's own description still had him standing. No case had anybody dead,
so the line rendered nowhere and the bench was blind to it. The corpus gained
`ending-take-the-writ-over-the-dead` in The Unrecorded Hour (Halkett Rowe dead
in Ward Office 12; the bench does not play The Lunar Cartographer, see
`Eval::Prompt::STORIES`), and both sides were bought on the six cases:

```bash
rake eval:prompt_compare BEFORE=prompt-ending-before-2026-10-02 AFTER=prompt-ending-after-2026-10-02
```

**NOISE on every figure.** The five Iron Gate cases sent byte-identical
requests both sides, so their spread is the run-to-run spread. No check reads a
dead person written as standing in a single turn, so the line's own case was
read by hand: without the line none of the four endings mentions Rowe, with it
two of four name him and none has him standing. `prompt-ending-after-2026-10-02`
is the ending's current baseline; its README has the readings.

### Serial, for now

`Eval::Concurrency` names this bench as its second caller and the seam is
already under every case — `Stage.open` runs inside a pinned connection. What is
not here is a second call in flight, and the reason is a design question rather
than an oversight: this bench stages **one copy of the world per case**, so two
cases in flight are two stagings in flight, and that isolation is exactly what a
`take` and a `drop` against one position need. Batching them means staging per
position and isolating the cases some other way, which is a decision about what
a case is. **So a latency on this board is a serial figure**: what one player
waits, with nothing queued behind it. A 90-case run at REPS=4 is about twenty
minutes.

### What it is not

**It does not tune a prompt**, and it is **not a substitute for
`rake eval:run`.** A single turn cannot show pacing, a world that moved, a check
that reads two consecutive turns, or the drift a player suffers three turns after
a narration invented a door. The protocol is: judge a prompt-shaped change here
first, confirm it there.

---

## The realization bench

The prompt bench measures the call the player READS. This measures the call that
builds the world they read it in — `Location::Generator`'s prompt blocks: **who
is here**, **what is lying here**, **what this room is called** and **the ways
out**. Until this existed none of them had an instrument at all, which is why
the cast fix shipped on judgement and the roadmap-era exit findings could not be
measured either way. **What this bench covers is declared in
`Location::Generator`'s header**, beside the blocks themselves — the naming
block is the one that arrived with the instrument already there.

**The one number anybody had was a hand count**: 36% of a generated world's exits
named a place the story already had, and its deepest room wrote its ways out and
every one led back up. A hand count is not a baseline — it cannot be re-run, it
has no band, and no prompt change can be judged against it.

```bash
rake eval:realization                        # 21 stubs x 4 reps x 2 calls x 1 model, ~$0.20
rake eval:realization_score SET=name         # score a stored set again -- offline, free, no key
rake eval:realization_compare BEFORE=a AFTER=b
rake eval:realization_board                  # every stored set as one table
rake eval:realization_digest                 # which prompts THIS TREE would send -- offline, free, no key
```

**Ask `realization_digest` first, before you spend anything.** It assembles the
two prompts every designated case would send, digests them exactly as a run
does, and says whether the checked-in baseline measured them
(`Eval::Realization::Version.offline`). A baseline that still matches is a
baseline you already own — the before side of your change, bought and paid for
by somebody else. A baseline that does not match means the before side has to be
taken fresh, and it tells you that for nothing rather than after a run.

| knob | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `REPS=4` | repetitions. **Four is the default because four is `Eval::Noise::MIN_RUNS`** |
| `MODELS=a,b` | **the arm selector**, `Eval::Classifier::Arm` and not a second one. Defaults to ONE model — `BaseAgent::REMOTE_MODEL_IDS.first`, which is what a player's rooms are really written by |
| `SET=name` | where the numbers land (`tmp/eval/<set>/realization.json`). Defaults to a timestamp |
| `SAMPLE=12` | how many flagged cases the board prints in full |
| `SAMPLE_CASES=4` | run only the first n cases — a smoke test for a few cents |
| `YES=1` | spend past the $1.00 ceiling |

`rake eval:estimate` prints what a baseline costs before anything is spent.

### How a case works

A case is **a world, a room in it, and the moment before that room was written.**
`Eval::Realization::Stage` loads the world under a title of its own, winds the
room back to the stub it was — no description, no lore, nothing lying in it, one
way out — and then runs `Location::Generator#realize!` whole. **Nothing is
stood in for.** The prompt bench has to replace the classifier because a second
model between the case and the passage would change the branch; a realization
has no such seam and needs none.

The keys that do the work are **declared and not derived**, because none of them
is recoverable from the records — connections carry no timestamp, and
`created_at` says when a row appeared, not what the world looked like around it:

| key | what it says |
| --- | --- |
| `reached_from` | the ONE neighbour whose realization created this stub — the way back |
| `also_reaches` | the other neighbours this stub could ALREADY reach, and nothing by default: every edge but the way back is removed unless a case names it here. The `two-ways-out` cases declare it, and they are the only ones that stage a stub already partly connected — which is the only state where the allowance in the prompt is below the cap |
| `absent` | rooms that did not exist yet — destroyed |
| `unwritten` | rooms that existed but had not been written — wound back to stubs, so the prompt does not mark them *already written* |
| `expects_new_ground` | whether the story points onward from here. **A dead end that names only the way back is the RIGHT answer** — the prompt asks for exactly that — so `no_new_ground` is judged only where this is true |

Everything else the model is told is read out of the records that world really
holds: the universe, the preface, the allowances, the places that already exist
and which of them are written, the names already spoken for, and the cast slots
the engine rolled.

### What it measures, and how little of it reads prose

**Almost every check is a set comparison** — a name the model wrote against a
closed list of names the prompt handed it, or a count against a number the
prompt stated. Both sides are records, so a rate here is the same kind of fact
`rake game:sweep` produces rather than a reading. The ones that read words are
`Eval::Realization::Scorer::KEYWORD_CHECKS`, marked `[KEYWORD]` beside their
rate in both the terminal report and the markdown board, and named for what
they can actually see; `Eval::Realization::Scorer` owns the table, and the
checks are:

| check | what it catches |
| --- | --- |
| `exit_into_a_written_room` | an exit into a place already written that this room cannot reach. The prompt marks those; the engine drops the edge, so the room loses a way out |
| `exit_already_reachable` | an exit the room already had, which the prompt lists and says does not need naming again. **Gated the way `no_new_ground` is**: a case that declared no new ground and answered with the way back and nothing else gave the answer the exits prompt asks a dead end for, so it is out of the denominator rather than flagged — see `Eval::Realization::Scorer`'s header for the two prompt sentences that contradict each other there |
| `exit_spelled_a_place_differently` | an exit that named a place the world already held, written another way — `WorldSeed.natural_key`'s reading of the same name, which is the one the engine resolves through (`Location::Generator#find_location`). **Not a defect of the model's**: `Location::ExitsSchema` asks for a name with no article while the prompt lists the world's places as stored, so obeying the schema on *The Vestry Hulk* produces *Vestry Hulk*. It is a rate of the BLIND SPOT in the checks beside it — `#place_for` matches the written string, so a name in this shape is invisible to `exits_restating`, `exit_already_reachable` and `no_new_ground` and is counted as new ground it is not. Judgeable on every exit name that MEANS an existing place; flagged where the two readings disagree |
| `exit_named_this_room` | an exit that names the room it leads out of |
| `exit_over_the_allowance` | more ways out than the prompt said were left |
| `no_new_ground` | a room the story points into whose every exit was a place the world already had — or that named no way out at all. **This is the Blackfang Tunnel defect** |
| `person_over_the_allowance` / `item_over_the_allowance` | more people or things than the prompt allowed. Since 2026-09-07 the people half is a count and not a ceiling (`Location::Population`), so an answer with too FEW people is a failed call the rotation sees rather than a figure here — the schema requires exactly the number the prompt states |
| `name_already_spoken_for` | a name the world had already given to somebody, somewhere or something |
| `proposal_refused` | what the registries would not admit — read off the records, and the superset of every reason above |
| `readable_without_words` | a thing marked readable with nothing written on it, which costs a later round trip to `Item::Inscriber` |
| `room_name_refused` | a room asked to name itself that came away still called its placeholder, **read off the room's own name after the call**. `Location::RoomName` refuses a proposal on several separate grounds and every one ends the same way, so this asks the record what happened rather than re-deciding it. Judgeable only on an `interior-room` case, where the prompt asks for a name at all. **It measures the prompt and the engine together, so it is the one check a set can go stale on without the corpus or the prompt moving**: reading the name AFTER the engine decided means a new refusal ground changes the figure. `db/eval/room-names-after-bef7cec` was recorded before `Location::RoomName#repeats_place?` existed, so this row of that set is not like-for-like with HEAD |
| `room_name_already_taken` | a proposed room name the world had already given to somewhere, somebody or something — the one refusal above that is a set comparison, against the same closed list of names `name_already_spoken_for` reads. The evidence says whether the prompt had shown it |
| `inside_declined` | an exit named with no `inside` pick at all. The field is **optional**, so an absent one is a legal answer and the engine takes `no inside` — which means the ordinary way for a world to end up with no buildings in it is not a model saying no, it is a model saying nothing. Judgeable on every exit of every case that made an exits call |
| `inside_on_a_place_that_already_exists` | an inside pick on an exit that named a place the world already held, so `Location::Generator#connect_exit!` reused that row and **threw the pick away** — it hands `inside:` to `.create_stub!` and nowhere else. A record on both sides: `facts["places"]` is what the world held and `after["new_places"]` is what the call opened, and BOTH halves are needed — before the duplicate-place fix of 2026-09-08 an article variant did open a second row, so a historical pick of that shape reached the world (badly) and is not flagged. Judgeable on every inside pick of a set that records what a call opened |
| `inside_where_the_world_wanted_none` / `no_inside_where_the_world_wanted_one` | the pick against the case's **hand label**, `expects_inside`, both ways round. That label is a **quantifier** — one of `none of them`, `at most one`, `at least one`, `every one` (`Lab::Exits::QUANTIFIERS`) — so the first of the pair is the CEILING half (an answer that opened more buildings than the label allows) and the second the FLOOR half (an answer that picked fewer insides than it asks for). Each of the four words has exactly one of the two bounds, so exactly one check is judgeable on a case. **The two names are the boolean era's words for the two directions and are deliberately unchanged**: a check key is what a stored set's figures are filed under, and renaming one would make every kept set read `not recorded` for a question it did measure. A row stored before the widening carries `true` or `false` and is read as `at least one` and `none of them`, which is exactly what the two checks always did with them (`Lab::Exits::FROM_BOOLEAN`) — so a stored set scores identically either side of the change. The one pair of checks in this bench that is not a record on both sides: there is no record of what a world *should* have been. **Most cases carry no label and are out of both denominators** — `expects_new_ground`'s rule, and `Eval::Realization::Corpus`'s header says which cases carry one. The ceiling half is judged on the insides that **opened a place**, not on the picks made: a pick the engine discarded left a world that wanted no building still holding none, and convicting it was reporting a fault with no consequence. What the model said is measured one row up. **So a promoted vantage's rate here is not `Lab::Exits::HitRate`'s rate for the same word** — that scores both directions on the picks given, because a lab measures what the model said and a bench what the game got |
| `population_declined` | an exit named with no `population` word at all, so the engine rolled one for the place. **`inside_declined`'s figure one field over**: the field asks and nothing rests on the asking (`Location::ExitsSchema`), so the ordinary way for a population pick to come to nothing is not a model answering `nobody` but a model answering nothing. `populations_given` and `crowds_picked` are printed beside it, because a model that picked `nobody` everywhere would have made the pick honestly and emptied the world anyway |
| `people_short_of_the_pick` | a room asked for an exact number of people that came back with fewer — the defect the exact population pick addresses, read against a real provider rather than against the JSON schema. Judgeable only where people were asked for, so a room the pick called empty is out of the denominator rather than counted a success |
| `parameters_declined` | a building offered the `parameters` block that came back without one, so every pick fell to its quietest default. Judgeable only on a `place` case, which is a stub carrying a footprint and no rooms |
| `parameters_the_engine_narrowed` | a building whose picks the layout could not honour — a warren on a footprint that holds one room, a depth the storeys do not reach. **Read off the rows the layout wrote**, because none of the picks has a column. Only the two picks that CAN fail to arrive are checked: danger, gradient and hazard are rates, so a place that picked `dangerous` and rolled quiet rooms was unlucky and not narrowed |
| `race_not_named` | **a KEYWORD check** — see below |
| `size_the_records_do_not_hold` | **a KEYWORD check.** The description stated a size in paces, or a storey, that is not this room's. Judgeable only on an `interior-room` case, where `Location::Plan` stated the numbers in the prompt |

**The inside and parameters checks report `unavailable` the same way, and one of
them reports something better than that.** A set stored before the `inside` field
existed has no pick on any exit, which is not a gap — it is the genuine BEFORE
figure for `inside_declined`, because a world whose exits carried no pick got no
buildings, which is exactly what the check measures. The two labelled checks and
both parameters checks are unavailable on such a set, because their denominators
are facts the bench had not begun storing.

**And three reported figures are the ones to read beside them.**
`insides_given` is the dominant-strategy check on the inside pair — *the cheapest
way to clear both rates is to answer `no inside` every time*. `insides_reaching`
is that same figure cut by **what the player got**: named exits whose inside pick
opened a place, over named exits. The distance between the two is picks the
engine threw away, and it is not small — on the surviving row-bearing set
`tmp/eval/interior-entry-after-2` the medians are 0.314 given against 0.129
reaching. It is `unavailable` on a set stored before the rows recorded what a
call opened, and never 0.000. Then
`hazard_below_ground` against `hazard_on_the_ground_floor` is the figure for the
gradient, the only one that reads whether it did anything at all.
Both are off the rows; neither is ever folded into a rate.

**The two name checks report `unavailable` on a set stored before the naming ask
existed**, and that is the honest reading rather than a gap. Their denominator
is the rooms the prompt actually asked to name themselves — a fact stored on the
row as `name_asked` — so a set recorded before `Location::DetailSchema` carried
a `name` has the key nowhere and is out of both, instead of reporting a model
failing to answer a question nobody put to it. It is
`Eval::Realization::Scorer::Reading#records_the_way_back?`'s rule, and it means
the before side of a naming comparison shows the checks arriving rather than a
rate falling.

**The keyword checks are weighed differently and labelled `[KEYWORD]` beside
their own rate**, in the board's table and in the report. The note beneath that
table is written off `Eval::Realization::Scorer::KEYWORD_CHECKS` too, so it
cannot come to name a different set from the one the rows are marked with.

The geometry check is halfway between a reading and a comparison, and it is
worth saying which half is which: what it COMPARES is a record and nothing else
— a number out of `Location::Box`, off the very `Location::Plan` the prompt was
built from — while what it READS is prose.
`Story::Audit::Prose.size_claims` and `.storey_claims` are the grammars, and
both were measured before they shipped: **0 detections over all 367 real
passages in the four corpora**. Over the room prose of every world in the
repository every sentence they detect agrees with the box it was written from,
and almost all of them are prose the ENGINE itself wrote
(`Location::Interior.teaser_for`) — `Story::Audit::Prose`'s `Size` header owns
that measurement, including the count and what moves it. A description that
contradicts its plan in a sentence neither grammar reads is a miss, which is why
this sits here rather than with the set comparisons.

**WHICH WALL A DOOR IS IN IS STATED IN THE PROMPT AND IS NOT CHECKED.** It was a
check, `door_the_records_do_not_hold`, and it is now
`door_in_a_wall_the_records_do_not_hold` in
`Eval::Realization::UNAVAILABLE_TO_A_REALIZATION` — reported unanswered rather
than as a rate. `Location::Plan#closed_walls_clause` tells the model no other
wall of the room holds a door, so the prose it invites names the DOORLESS walls
in the same breath as the doors — *"A door in the north wall gives back onto the
landing, and another in the east wall leads on; the south wall is hung with
tarred canvas"* — and six successive grammars each read one of those as a door
claim of its own. A threshold anywhere in the sentence, then a character bridge,
then an attached anaphor, then a forward-binding rule, then a closed list of
three attachment forms, then that list with the inversion fronted: each closed
one shape and admitted the next, which is how a prose heuristic dies here (see
`Story::Audit`'s header, which carries the full record, the sentences that
settled it, and the two heuristics it killed before this one). Telling a real
claim from a doorless wall named beside a door needs the sentence's verbs and
objects — a parser, not a regex — and a zero off any of those six grammars would
have been a clean-looking lie on the bench this baseline is bought from. **The
prompt did not move:** `Location::Plan` still states every door's wall, because
that is a record read out, and the doors are `LocationConnection` rows no
description can add to (`Location::Generator#write_exits!` asks a room inside a
place for no exits at all).

**The check convicts prose of no claim the prompt itself made.**
`Location::Plan` states more than the room's own box, so there are two
discounts, and each is `#correct_dead_end?`'s rule kept — a rate the check did
not earn is worse than no rate.

* The PLACE's footprint in paces is in the plan's storey sentence, so a pace pair
  equal to it *agrees* — counted, not flagged.
* A storey the prompt states of something that is not this room cannot be told
  from a false claim about the room, so that claim leaves the **denominator**
  rather than being merely unflagged. There are two: *"storey 0 is the ground
  floor"*, which every plan ends with, and the far storey of each stair
  (*"a stair up to The Custom House room 5, on storey 1"*). The room's **own**
  storey is compared and agrees, so it counts; a storey the plan states nowhere
  is judged.

Both sets are read off the plan hash — `Reading#paces_stated` and
`Reading#storeys_stated` — and not off a list of remembered clauses, because
three separate rounds of review found a prompt-stated number about to be
reported as a defect. `Location::Plan` is the one author of what the prompt
states, so a sentence added there is covered by construction.

**What `race_not_named` can and cannot see.** The engine writes the rolled race
onto the row whatever the model answers, so the RECORD is never wrong and the
PROSE can be: a Nocturna-Blighted slot described as a nervous clerk is a person
the room is wrong about, and every later conversation inherits it. What the
check can see is the race name missing from the sheet. What it cannot see is a
compliant person written entirely in chitin and silence. **Its false-positive rate is unknown until a baseline is
bought** — which is the discipline two earlier prose-reading checks failed, and
the reason it is named for what it can see rather than for what it would like to
mean.

**And the counts are printed beside the rates and never folded in.** The cheapest
way to clear every rate above is to write one exit and nobody: a room that names
only the way back cannot restate a place it should not have, cannot open a door
into a written room and cannot exceed its allowance. **The people half of that
argument is now the schema's**, since the count is exact — an answer with nobody
in a room the engine asked two people for fails the call — but the figures are
still printed, because the schema cannot make a person worth talking to. So `exits_named`,
`new_places_opened`, `new_places_named`, `people_named`, `items_named` and
`people_take_up` have no better direction and are reported next to the defects.
This is `Eval::Richness`'s argument applied to rooms.

**`new_places_opened` and `new_places_named` are two different figures.** The
first is read off the records `Eval::Realization::Bench#after` wrote — what the
room really brought into existence. The second is a reading of the answer, and
`Location::Generator#write_exits!` stops connecting when the allowance runs out,
so a room that named more places than it had room for opened fewer than it
named.

`exits_restating` — the original 36% hand count — is **reported and not scored**, because
the prompt asks for reuse when an exit leads somewhere already known. The three
narrower shapes above it are the defects.

### The corpus

`test/fixtures/files/realization_corpus.yml` — cases across **five worlds:
three seeded, one generated, and one that exists to be walked**. The validator
runs offline in `bin/rails test` and stages every case against the world file it
names, so a room somebody renamed is a failing test rather than a hole in a paid
run.

**`The Iron Gate Descends` is a GENERATED world**, exported with
`rake 'game:export[7]'` and frozen at `test/fixtures/files/worlds/`. It is
deliberately NOT under `db/seeds/worlds`: everything there is loaded into every
development database and into `Eval::Base`'s base world, so putting it there
would add a fourth world to every sweep as a side effect of building an
instrument. It is in the corpus because the defect was measured in it, and a
corpus of nothing but hand-authored seeds would be a corpus of worlds a person
wrote the neighbours of.

**`The Lunar Cartographer` IS played here**, though `rake eval:prompt` refuses
it. That bench refuses it because `WorldMechanic::ShuffleConnections` repoints
its doorways on the story's clock and `Playthrough::Turn#play` catches the world
up before it narrates. **This bench plays no turn** — no `Scene` is written and
no clock advances — so the doorways are the ones the seed file lists, on the
hundredth repetition as on the first. It is also the only world with a bestiary,
which is what makes `race_not_named` judgeable at all.

**`The Quay House` is the only world with an INSIDE**, and its three
`interior-room` cases are the only ones in the corpus that measure a room the
room builder may not name a way out of. `Location::Interior` laid The Custom
House out in one call from one seeded roll and `rake game:export` wrote what it
produced, so the boxes and doors those cases stand on are the engine's own
arithmetic. It lives under `lib/engine_sweep/worlds/` — the third of
`Eval::Realization::WORLD_ROOTS`, read last — because that is where it already
was, and a second copy of a generated floor plan would be a second thing to keep
in step with the generator.

**Those cases measure ONE call and not two, on purpose.** A room inside a
laid-out place has its ways out from the engine, so
`Location::Generator#write_exits!` asks a model for none of them: every exit
check is out of its own denominator by construction, and what the detail prompt
carries instead is the room's own floor plan — and, for a room still called one
of its place's numbers, the ask that it name itself, which is why they are also
the only cases the two name checks are judgeable on. Two things follow, and both
are written down in code rather than assumed. The corpus validator's "no room left
for a way out" rule does not apply to them
(`Eval::Realization::Corpus#problems_for`), and the STAGING DOES NOT WIND THEIR
EDGES BACK (`Eval::Realization::Stage#wind_back!`) — every other stub's edges
arrived with its realization, while these arrived with the layout, so dropping
one would stage a room the engine never laid out. The estimate still prices
every case at two calls, which over-prices these three: an estimate that comes
in under is a nasty surprise and one that comes in over is not.

`The Salt Assizes` is **held out**, reported apart and never pooled.

### The one input that is not constant, and why

`Character::Registry#slots` rolls the race, age and sex of everybody a
realization may name, and the prompt states them per slot. Two of those three
are **not seeded at all** — `rand(18..80)` and `Character.sexes.values.sample`
are Kernel's own generator — and the third keys on `story_id` and `location.id`,
which a staged copy re-issues on every load. So those lines legitimately differ
between two repetitions of one case.

**And so is the count the people block asks for:** the narrator picks how
populated a place is from a closed list and the engine rolls the count inside
that word's band
(`Location::Population`). A room a seed file left silent about carries no word,
so the label is rolled too — and although it is seeded on the room's NAME
rather than on its id, precisely so that a staged copy of a world keeps it, the
count is drawn from the room's own generator and that does key on the id. So the
count varies between repetitions and the line stating it is scrubbed **by
position** — the line under `## Who Is Here`, whichever of the two sentences
`#people_instructions` put there. The bullets around it stay inside the digest,
so a reworded instruction still moves the version.

They are **scrubbed before the prompt digest is taken, and recorded rather than
pinned.** Pinning would mean the bench re-implementing `#slots` — a second
implementation of the one thing in the app that decides who a new person is,
which is precisely the failure every file here is written to avoid. What the
bench does instead is record what was offered, so `people_offered` is a measured
denominator rather than an assumed one. What it costs, stated rather than
hidden: a figure that turned on WHICH race a slot drew would need more
repetitions than one that does not. Everything else in the prompt is supposed to
be constant, and `prompt_stable` is the check on that claim —
`Eval::Realization::Version` has it in full.

### The baseline there is, and what it does not cover

`db/eval/` holds the interior-entry pair -- `interior-entry-before/` and the
after side named by `Eval::Realization::BASELINE` -- which is the before/after of
stage one: the `inside` pick on the exits call and the `parameters` block on a
building's detail call. Read the numbers there. The before side is the honest
zero for every new check: on a tree where nothing offers the picks, every exit
declines, every building declines, and no room anywhere carries a hazard.

`db/eval/room-names-after-bef7cec/` is the older one, kept: the set the room
naming block was re-baselined on once its change had been judged, which is
step 3 of the rule this file opens with. It is a **summary** — every pass's
figures and no rows, `Eval::Realization::Result#summary`'s form — so it renders
its own column on `rake eval:realization_board` and gives its own side of a
verdict on `rake eval:realization_compare`, offline and for free. Read the
numbers there; this file states none of them, because a figure quoted in prose
is a figure that goes stale silently.

It is also what `Eval::Realization::BASELINE` names, and pointing that constant
at a new set is what re-baselining IS: `Eval::Realization::KeptSetTest` holds the
named set to today's corpus digest **and** to today's prompt digest, so a
realization prompt edited without a run to judge it is a failing test rather than
a judgement nobody could make.

Its name is the run id, so the run and the checked-in summary can be tied
together from a PR body. **What was bought:** a before/after pair on
`Location::Generator#name_instruction`, judged before the prompt shipped. The
before side lives in the PR that shipped it and is not checked in — a baseline
is kept for the state of the prompt that IS in the tree.

**One row of it is not like-for-like with HEAD, and it is the one this bench
cannot re-score its way out of.** The set was recorded at `bef7cec`, and review
afterwards added a refusal ground the engine did not have then —
`Location::RoomName#repeats_place?`. `room_name_refused` is read off the room's
name AFTER the engine decided (see the checks table), so that check measures the
prompt and the engine together and a new refusal ground moves it. Re-scoring
cannot repair it, because the refusal happens at write time and not at score
time. So a later naming-prompt change judged against this set would read part of
an engine change as a prompt effect on that one row — take its before side fresh
if `room_name_refused` is what the change is about. Everything else in the set
stands: the corpus digest is today's, the arm and the repetitions are recorded,
and the rooms its interior cases stand in all still carry placeholders, so
`Location::RoomName.for` keeps them in both name checks' denominators.

**It does not stand in for the rest of the prompt.** The corpus and the arm are
this set's, so it is a baseline for a naming change and not for a change to
`Location::Generator`'s people, items or exits instructions: judging one of
those means buying its own before side first, at `rake eval:realization` —
`rake eval:estimate` prints what that costs today rather than this sentence.
Which is the whole point of the rule this file opens with: the baseline is per
change, and the set in the repository is the after side of the one change that
has had one.

### A corpus change re-baselines it too, and `kind-to-corpus-after` is the case

`db/eval/kind-to-corpus-after/` is what `Eval::Realization::BASELINE` names now,
and it is the one kind of re-baseline this file had not yet had an example of:
**no prompt moved at all.** What moved was the corpus SCHEMA — a case may now
carry the stub typed in `Lab::Realization` and its `expects_*` block with it,
and `Eval::Realization.digest` folds every field that changes what was
measured. So the same twenty-two cases in the same worlds produced a new corpus
digest, `Eval::Realization::KeptSetTest` began failing, and the set that had been
the baseline stopped being one for this tree while remaining a true reading of
these prompts.

**Both halves of that are worth keeping straight**, because it is the situation
somebody will next mistake for a prompt regression. The proof that the prompts did
not move is on the two sets themselves: `prompt_digest` is identical across them,
and so is every one of the nine per-shape digests in `prompt_shapes` — the same
bytes, on the same nine designated cases. The compare between them therefore
prints the WARNING that the two sets built different rooms, which is correct and
expected here: the digest moved, and the warning cannot know that the cases behind
it did not.

**Read it as a null check, because that is what it is** — the same prompt measured
twice, months of nothing between it, and every CHECK duly reads NOISE. The one
figure that separates is a *reported* count and not a check, it is a rolled
per-room quantity (`Location::Parameters::HAZARD_SHARE` of `HAZARD_DIE`), and it
rests on the corpus's single `place` case — ONE building per repetition, which came
back from the model with a different room count this time. Reading it as a prompt
effect would be flagging the dice, which is what `Eval::Realization::Scorer`'s
header and `Lab::Realization::HitRate`'s both forbid in so many words. The figures
are in the two sets and in the PR that bought this one; this file quotes none of
them.

`room-people-after` is kept beside it as history, and it is still the after side of
the room-people change and the before side of the pair above.

### The noise band, as a checked-in pair

`db/eval/null-2026-09-07/` is this bench's null check kept as a file: the same
corpus, the same model, the same `prompt_digest` as the set beside it, four
repetitions, bought a second time. Everything that moves between the two is the
bench disagreeing with itself, and
`rake eval:realization_compare BEFORE=room-people-after AFTER=null-2026-09-07`
prints all of it offline and for free. `Eval::Realization::NullSetTest` holds the
pair to what it is and asserts the only claim it makes -- that no figure
separates -- rather than quoting a figure into prose.

**Read it before believing a REAL verdict.** `rake eval:null` splits one set's
runs in half, which is the cheap version of this; a whole second run is the
honest one, because it carries the between-run variation a split-half cannot.

It was bought by accident, and it is kept rather than deleted because a null
check is the run the protocol asks for that nobody ever wants to fund. What it
cost is in the PR that added it.

### What it is not

**It does not tune a prompt**, and it is **not a substitute for
`rake eval:run`.** A room measured on its own cannot show what it is like to
walk into three turns later, whether the exits it wrote led anywhere a player
wanted to go, or what its description did to the narration that followed. Judge
a realization prompt change here first, confirm it there.

---

## The instrument this is not: `rake game:sweep`

Everything above measures **narration**, costs money and is noisy enough to need
a rank test. The engine sweep is the other half and shares none of those
properties:

| | `rake eval:run` | `rake game:sweep` | `rake eval:classifier` | `rake eval:prompt` | `rake eval:realization` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| what it reads | prose, against the records | the records, after a typed line | the classifier's answer, against a label | one turn of prose, against fixed facts | one room's answer, against the records it was built from |
| what it needs | a key, the network, minutes, dollars | nothing | a key, minutes, cents | a key, minutes, cents | a key, minutes, cents |
| what it answers | a rate with a noise floor | pass or fail | a rate with a noise floor | a rate with a noise floor | a rate with a noise floor |
| in CI | never | every `bin/rails test` | its offline floor and its corpus validator, yes; the calls, never | its corpus validator and its scorer, yes; the calls, never | its corpus validator, its stage and its scorer, yes; the calls, never |

It plays stored scripts through `Playthrough::Mechanics` with **no model at all**
— the classifier off, `Playthrough::Grammar` in front of the engine, and
`BaseAgent.new` replaced for the length of the run so a call from anywhere raises
rather than reaching a provider. Each script loads its own copy of a seeded world
and rolls it back, so it can be run against a database somebody is mid-game in.

**A script can now say WHICH READER answered a line** (`resolved_by:`), which
matters because the browser reads a slashed or verb-first line with that same
grammar before spending a classifier call. `model` is unreachable in a walk by
construction, so what a script pins is `grammar` and `engine_view` —
`lib/engine_sweep/scripts/a-slash-in-front-of-the-line.yml` is the walk, and its
claim is an equivalence: a slashed line and its plain twin leave the same
records. **The offline half of the classifier bench is unaffected** by that
routing: `Eval::Classifier::Offline` reaches `Playthrough::Grammar#parse`, and
the deferring guard the browser uses (`JOINING_WORDS`) lives on
`#reading_first`, one level above it — so the offline floor is byte-identical
across the change.

**It asserts; it does not measure.** There is no rate, no baseline and no
comparison, because there is no sampling: two runs of a script are identical to
the row. A change to movement, to exits, to item possession or to what the
grammar refuses either keeps the scripts green or does not.

Both instruments walk the same three seeded worlds, and `The Salt Assizes` being
held out does not apply here: holding it out is about not tuning narration checks
on prose nobody has read, and the sweep reads no prose. See README → *Sweep the
engine*.

---

## What is measured

The checks all come from `Story::Audit`, all offline and deterministic, in
categories that are never merged — see its header, where the checks and their
categories are defined. Each one counts an error that is objectively present or
absent, and each was measured for false positives on real prose before it
shipped.

**Two of them read a change rather than a state**, which is new and is the
reason the board's recall was poor before. `take_denied` and `pickup_invented`
read a narration against `Scene#resolved_action` and `Scene#acted_on` — what
the turn DID, written by `Playthrough::Turn#play` beside the typed line. The
app owns `take` and `drop` outright, so on a turn recorded as one of them the
state *before* the turn is not in question either, and the prose is the only
loose half. They are the first two checks that are fully available to a sweep
**and** fully available offline: a script's fixed line has no bearing on what
the narrator does with a fact it was handed, so they are deliberately not in
`Eval::UNAVAILABLE_TO_A_SCRIPT`.

**Richness is reported beside them and never folded in.** It counts what the
prose committed to: the room, the exits, the items and the people the records
know, named in the passage. It exists because the cheapest way to stop the
narrator contradicting the records is to make it say less — vague prose asserts
nothing, so it cannot be wrong. A change that buys a lower contradiction rate
with blander prose has to show up as a loss somewhere, and this is where. It is
**not** a quality score, and it is gameable on its own: read it only as a
counterweight. `Eval::Richness` has the measurement and the one normalisation
that was tried and thrown out.

---

## The held-out world

`The Salt Assizes` is played by every sweep and used to tune nothing.

Every check in `Story::Audit` was measured against passages from the other two
worlds — `narration_corpus.json` and `eval_corpus.json` are drawn from them — so
the held-out world is prose no check has ever seen. A rate that holds up on it is
a rate that did not come from fitting the passages.

**This is a documented convention, not enforced machinery.** The rule:

- Tune on `Eval::TUNING`. Report on `Eval::HELD_OUT`.
- Do not read a held-out passage while changing a check.
- Do not add a held-out passage to a fixture.

`Eval::Board` prints the two corpora apart and labels them, so an accidental
pooling is visible in the output. When an agent is driving this loop rather than
a person, that convention needs teeth; today it does not have them.

---

## The frozen corpus, and how it grows

`test/fixtures/files/eval_corpus.json` is the regression line: real passages out
of recorded playthroughs with the records around them written down,
plus the 24 lab narrations, checked in so they need no database.
`Story::Scoreboard::Corpus` reads it and its header says what a passage carries
and which checks it therefore cannot answer.

**`rake game:corpus` is the only thing that writes it.** It reads this machine's
database, takes every judged turn and the turns either side of
it, derives the facts beside each passage through `Story::Audit`'s own readers,
and merges by scene: a row already there has its verdict and note brought up to
date, a row that is not is appended, and nothing is ever removed. `DRY_RUN=1`
prints what would change. `Story::Scoreboard::Capture`'s header is the rule in
full — what an amended verdict does, why the `lab/` rows are untouchable, and
why a captured passage and its facts stay frozen even when a re-derivation
would now answer differently.

Two things it deliberately does not do:

- **It never writes `expect`.** That is the hand-signed list of flags somebody
  read and defended. A new row arrives with it empty, so
  `Story::Scoreboard::CorpusTest` fails until each flag the row earns has been
  judged sentence by sentence. A capture that filled it in would turn the
  pinned test into a test that agrees with whatever the checks currently do.
- **It never captures the held-out world.** Verdicts recorded on
  `Eval::HELD_OUT` are counted in the task's summary and skipped, so the rule
  below is visible in the output rather than silent.

After a refresh: read the new flags, sign for them in the test, then
`rake game:score CORPUS=corpus SAVE=1` so the movement report compares like with
like — the board warns when the corpus changed size, and that warning is why the
re-baseline is part of the job rather than a follow-up.

---

## The transition corpus

`test/fixtures/files/transition_corpus.json` is 119 turns that the classifier
resolved to a `take` or a `drop`, cut out of the `rake eval:run` databases on
this machine on 2026-09-03 before they were lost. `Story::Scoreboard::Transitions`
scores it and `rake game:score CORPUS=transitions` prints it.

Each row carries the typed line, the resolved action, the item, **where that
item was before the turn and after it**, the closed set the classifier was
offered, and the prose. The action was recovered offline from the classifier's
own stored answer (the legacy `messages.content_raw`, kept by default since PR
97) and confirmed against that same prompt's list — no generation, no spend. The
position before and after needs no item history: `take` resolves against what
is lying in the room and `drop` against what the player is carrying, so the
action itself says where the row was.

**The set `main20` is the 24-run, 480-turn baseline** the manual read of that
day was done against; it carries exactly 32 takes and 32 drops, and every
headline figure is quoted for it:

| | flagged | of | rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `take_denied` | 28 | 32 | 87.5% |
| `pickup_invented` | 4 | 32 | 12.5% |

**Two things about this corpus are worse than the others and are stated rather
than hidden.**

- **It contains held-out passages.** `The Salt Assizes` is `Eval::HELD_OUT` and
  the convention above says not to add its passages to a fixture. It is in here
  because the run databases were about to be lost and freezing half of them
  would have thrown away half the evidence for nothing. The consequence is
  uneven: `take_denied` has positives in both worlds and an independent
  confirmation in `whole_run_corpus.json` (six real detections in the tuning
  world, every one on a turn that corpus records as a `take`), while
  `pickup_invented` has flags **only** in the held-out world. Its tuning-world
  evidence is that the grammar fires on real tuning prose — the two lab
  narrations of "burn the daybook in the grate" — plus a constructed positive
  case, not an independent rate.
- **It is two worlds and two items.** Every row argues about the "Assize
  tide-slate" or the "Ward Office 12 daybook", because those are the only items
  any seeded world has (`Item` rows are created in one place in the whole app,
  the seed loader — see `ta-item-registry`). A rate here is a rate over a lot of
  runs of a little prose.

---

## The measurement, and what an improving agent may not touch

`rake eval:manifest` prints the files that constitute the measurement, with a
digest of each. An agent set loose on improving the baseline changes the **game**
and none of these:

```
app/models/story/audit.rb            the checks
app/models/story/audit/prose.rb      what can be read out of a passage
app/models/story/scoreboard*.rb      the rates and the frozen corpus
lib/eval/**                          generation, scoring, noise, richness, cost
lib/tasks/eval.rake                  the commands
script/eval_run.rb                   the harness
db/eval_baseline.json                the line the next run moves against
test/fixtures/files/*_corpus.json    the passages the checks were measured on
lib/eval/classifier*                 the classifier bench
test/fixtures/files/classifier_corpus.yml   the 339 labelled lines
lib/eval/realization*                the realization bench
test/fixtures/files/realization_corpus.yml  the stubs it builds
test/fixtures/files/worlds/*.yml     the generated world it builds them in
```

Snapshot the digests before a change and again after: nothing in the list may
have moved. This is **declared, not enforced** — there is no hook and no lock.
It is here so that the skill which eventually drives this loop can say "these are
off-limits" without somebody having to work out which they are.

---

## Adding a check

The same bar every existing check cleared, and PR 99 killed five plausible
candidates against it:

1. **A demonstrated defect behind it.** Every check here answers an error found
   during play.
2. **A measured false-positive rate on real prose**, in a test, not in a commit
   message. The corpora are `eval_corpus.json` (grown by `rake game:corpus`;
   the count is pinned in `Story::Scoreboard::CorpusTest`),
   `narration_corpus.json` (24), `whole_run_corpus.json` (132 whole-run
   narrations with the records around them) and — for a check that reads a
   change — `transition_corpus.json` (119 real `take` and `drop` turns with the
   transition each one made frozen beside the prose).
3. **A demonstrated positive case.** A check that cannot fire looks exactly like
   a clean result, which is worse than no check. If the real corpora contain no
   violation, take a real sentence and move the record underneath it —
   `Story::Audit::ArrivalTest` is the worked example.
4. **A stated miss.** Every check here says where it knowingly gives up recall
   for precision.

A check that cannot be made precise is reported **unavailable**, never shipped
loose.

`inscription_misquoted` is the most recent one through this, and it is the
worked example of a check that clears the bar on precision and admits to poor
recall: 0 flags over all 367 real passages, one recorded narration as the
positive case, and two plausible widenings (`says` as a cue; the item's own
name) measured and killed at 7 and 3 flags of dialogue. Its stated miss is
larger than most — three live read narrations, two of which quote the record
inside quote marks, and it detected neither. See
`test/models/story/audit/inscription_test.rb`.

**A check that reads `Scene#engine_fact`** — the receipt of what the engine
handed a scene's writer — has one more corpus the four above cannot be: they
predate the receipt. The stored sets that carry one beside their prose are the
arrival and NPC sets under `db/eval` (the adversarial study's arms, whose
readers' labels are the precision reference, `arrival-branches` and the two
dialogue sets). `dead_shown_alive`, `carried_shown_lying` and
`handover_invented` are measured on them, and on the four corpora with a
receipt planted underneath, in `test/models/story/audit/receipt_test.rb`. A
scene with no receipt is counted unjudged, never clean.

## The dialogue bench

`Eval::Dialogue` promotes the fictional NPC study under
`db/eval/adversarial-20260909` into a standing, reproducible bench. The corpus
keeps its owned key, door, ceasefire, entrusted-key refusal and absent-crown
situations, then covers staying behind, a stale offered gift, a real move with a
follower, and an attack after a truce. Its stager header documents reconstruction
differences from the original study, whose evaluator source was not shipped.

```bash
# Use a scratch database for both pricing and replay:
export DATABASE_URL=sqlite3:tmp/dialogue.sqlite3
rake db:prepare ruby_llm:load_models
rake eval:estimate
EVAL_LIVE=1 \
  EVAL_BUDGET_FILE=tmp/dialogue-budget.json SET=my-dialogue rake eval:dialogue
rake eval:dialogue_score SET=physical-dialogue-20260910
rake eval:dialogue_board SET=physical-dialogue-20260910 ANNOTATIONS=path/to/annotations.json
rake eval:dialogue_compare BEFORE=physical-dialogue-20260910 AFTER=my-dialogue
rake eval:dialogue_digest SET=physical-dialogue-20260910
```

Run, score, board, compare and digest use the same named-set vocabulary as the
other benches. This sibling preserves `eval:prompt`'s exclusion of talk: a
character pass changes records before its narrated-exchange pass, and both
requests need identity. The kept set retains full requests, raw answers, actual
models and token/cost receipts. `dialogue_digest` replays each stored reaction
through today's request builders and engine gate, then compares system, user,
emitted schema and replayed history byte for byte. Different live reactions
produce different narrator requests; replaying the same saved reaction makes
that comparison meaningful. `KeptSetTest` performs it offline in CI.

State checks and failures are reported per repetition; comparison uses
`Eval::Noise`. A case's expected state is what follows if the character does
as asked; a follower who answers a request to stay with `none` has refused,
changes nothing and keeps following, and is scored that way
(`Eval::Dialogue::Result#expected`) — staying is only the explicit
`stop_following`. The default repetitions are `Eval::Noise::MIN_RUNS`. Word counts
measure length only. Contradiction judgments use the original
[`npc-protocol.md`](db/eval/adversarial-20260909/npc-protocol.md) and remain a
human input, beside state checks. Each annotation is keyed `case-id:rep` and
contains `contradiction` (boolean), `reason`, and `narration_digest` (SHA256 of the
displayed narration); a positive also requires `excerpt`, present in that prose.
`BEFORE_ANNOTATIONS` and `AFTER_ANNOTATIONS` supply those files to comparison.
Missing judgments are **unavailable**, never clean or an automated judge result.
Judge against the stored `immediate` facts: a subsequent attack does not make a
correctly narrated truce a contradiction. `facts` records the later engine state.

This bench does not measure voice, memory fidelity across turns, long-term
character behavior, or personality. A stored exchange exercises replay identity,
not memory quality. Paid runs use the study's pinned model and spending policy;
`Eval::Dialogue::Budget` reserves before each request, keeps unknown charges,
and stops at its declared ceiling. `Eval::Dialogue.estimate` prices the two-pass
shape from preserved usage against the current registry. Receipts distinguish
registry-priced usage, partial provider-reported billing and conservative budget
accounting. The task estimate, ledger and validation logs are under
`doc/evidence/ta-bench-npc-dialogue/`.
## Genesis: fixed world-creation boundaries

`Eval::Genesis` measures record fidelity at universe, story, protagonist and
quest generation, including the character duplicate-name follow-up. The cases
in `test/fixtures/files/genesis_corpus.yml` use the exported Iron Gate world's
upstream facts. The first-screen case visits its genesis boundaries in order;
room realization and arrival stay with their existing instruments. Generated
answers do not become the next producer's inputs: society and the duplicate
retry replay fixed assistant exchanges, so each repetition measures the same
request. `Eval::Genesis::Stage` owns these boundaries and the seeded engine picks.

```bash
rake ruby_llm:load_models              # price registry, offline
rake eval:estimate                    # includes genesis; does not buy calls
rake eval:genesis_digest              # every case: system, user, history, schema
rake eval:genesis SET=genesis-before MODEL=mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1
rake eval:genesis_score SET=genesis-before
rake eval:genesis_board SETS=genesis-before
rake eval:genesis_compare BEFORE=genesis-before AFTER=my-after
```

The default repetitions are `Eval::Noise::MIN_RUNS`, and the purchase guard is
`Eval::Genesis::Bench::SPEND_CEILING`. The estimator conservatively allows a token
per serialized request byte and schema-bounded output; it is an allowance, not
a measured historical average. The output limit is recorded with each call.
The pinned arm has neither model rotation nor provider retries. Every call is
retained, including the first; no unreported warm-up is bought.

`Eval::Genesis::BASELINE` names the kept set. Unlike realization's compact
summaries, genesis keeps raw answers, requests, schemas, engine facts and token
receipts so schema failures can be rescored offline. Costs use the prices
recorded at purchase, with cached input charged conservatively at full price;
they are token-accounted costs, not provider invoice claims. Each check has its
own judgeable denominator. Missing receipts and failed calls are reported beside
the defect rates; incomplete sets cannot produce a comparison.

These checks do **not** measure believability, identity fidelity in prose,
opener coherence or quest quality. Character attributes can be compared with
the engine's picks; a race implied in backstory cannot. Story place names and
quest target names are free text in today's schemas, so no check pretends they
must come from closed universe lists. The human-scored coherence lab remains a
separate task. Prompt and schema edits still follow the before/after protocol
above; a clean schema score does not authorize skipping it.
## First-read inscriptions

`rake eval:inscription SET=name` buys one `Item::Inscriber` call per fixed case,
with `REPS` defaulting to `Eval::Noise::MIN_RUNS` and `EVAL_MODEL` selecting one
pinned arm. Price first with `rake eval:inscription_estimate` or
`rake eval:estimate`, after `rake ruby_llm:load_models` has populated the scratch
registry. The estimator uses conservative byte-based token allowances; it is
not a measured tokenizer. Runs refuse an existing set rather than overwriting
receipts. Failed calls retain their returned usage before the app rewinds them;
a missing receipt stops further spend.

This is a sibling of the prompt bench because playing a read turn would buy
both inscription and narration. Its fixture selects readable objects from the
seeded worlds, fixing room, holder or party possession. The stage clears words
only in its rolled-back copy, then calls the real writer and records both the
raw answer and persisted inscription. Repeated reads and the template copy are
engine behavior; later narration quoting the words belongs to the existing
`inscription_misquoted` check, not this instrument.

```bash
rake eval:inscription_digest                         # no key or call
rake eval:inscription_score SET=inscription-2026-09-10 # replay raw answers
rake eval:inscription_board SET=inscription-2026-09-10
rake eval:inscription_compare BEFORE=before AFTER=after
```

The kept set under `db/eval/` contains every answer and receipt. Its versioned
`request_identity` and per-case identities cover system, user and emitted schema.
Only surrogate IDs in `Item#whereabouts` are normalized; the actual prompt is
also retained. Corpus identity includes the seed files. Comparison refuses
changed corpora or models, prints request-identity movement, and uses
`Eval::Noise` on per-repetition rates with tuning and held-out worlds apart.
Use the same before/after protocol as the other benches; do not rebaseline until
a change has been judged, including a possible `NOISE` verdict.

Mechanical checks flag empty text, length overflow, verbatim description reuse,
bounded reader-action/framing phrases, and unfinished sentence-like last lines.
Labels, dates and tallies need no full stop, so endings without a finite-verb cue
are **unavailable**, not clean. A regex cannot establish literalness or fit:
letters may legitimately say “I” or “you”, and a framing phrase might itself be
a fictional quotation. Read `Eval::Inscription::Scorer` for the precise limits.
Each board reading exposes nullable `human_fit` and `human_note` fields for a
future lab annotation pass; no lab page or automatic judgement of register,
meaning, plausibility or world fit is built here.

## Fixed arrival branches

`eval:arrival` stages destination records and buys one `Scene::Generator` call
per case. `test/fixtures/files/arrival_corpus.json` names the study cases and
opening, returning, wound, inventory, no-exit and pending-toll branches. Openings
have a protagonist and seeded population; an empty opening has no other people.
`Eval::Arrival::Stage` explains why this is a sibling of the ordinary turn bench.

```bash
DATABASE_URL=sqlite3:tmp/arrival/bench.sqlite3 bin/rails db:prepare
DATABASE_URL=sqlite3:tmp/arrival/bench.sqlite3 bundle exec rake ruby_llm:load_models
DATABASE_URL=sqlite3:tmp/arrival/bench.sqlite3 bundle exec rake eval:estimate
DATABASE_URL=sqlite3:tmp/arrival/bench.sqlite3 EVAL_LIVE=1 \
  EVAL_BUDGET_FILE=tmp/arrival/budget.json SET=my-arrival bundle exec rake eval:arrival
bundle exec rake eval:arrival_score SET=arrival-body-after-2026-10-02
bundle exec rake eval:arrival_board SET=arrival-body-after-2026-10-02
bundle exec rake eval:arrival_compare BEFORE=arrival-body-after-2026-10-02 AFTER=my-arrival
bundle exec rake eval:arrival_digest
```

The kept set is `Eval::Arrival::BASELINE`. Its test rebuilds **every** request
identity, including system, user, emitted schema and empty replay history, with
no provider call. No digest is borrowed from the ordinary main move case; that
set is measured and re-baselined separately by `Eval::Prompt`.

Description and summary have separate lexical checks, availability and rates.
Fact-missing strict/inclusive readings are **word-cue proxies**, not the study's
semantic judgments. `Eval::Arrival::Scorer` states each limit; its tests replay
precision and misses against the retained independent annotations. The board
prints both study readers beside those historical readings. New responses have
no annotation unless a reader supplies `ANNOTATIONS=path.json`: an object keyed
by the board's `response_identity`, with separate `description` and `summary`
objects holding contradiction, required-fact acknowledgment and rationale.
Labels never transfer merely because case names match. The original study
readers' provenance is retained; no new judge model is called.

Neither the regexes nor the corpus measure general semantic contradiction,
recognition quality on a revisit or prose quality. A clean lexical reading is
not evidence of those properties. Receipts include all attempts; superseded
fixture readings, when present, contribute to spend and not to baseline scores.

`first_thing_opener` asks whether a first visit's first sentence says "first
thing" -- the stock opener the discovery line invited while it read "what
catches them first on the way in". Arrival sets keep their rows, so it re-scores
every kept set offline. `arrival-branches`, bought before the line lost its
"first", reads 22 of 36; `arrival-first-visit-2026-09-28`, the baseline until 2026-10-02,
reads 14 of 36, a real difference with every other reading noise. It counts one
phrase and says nothing about how varied the openings are. That set's one
superseded row is a call the receipt halted because it could not read RubyLLM
2's usage fields; its charge is on the ledger.

**Who killed a body** is the `killed_resident` case: Maren Vosk, killed by the
player's blow an hour before the party walks in, so the arrival's dead line
carries "killed by Iri Calder about 1 hour ago". `arrival-body-before-2026-10-02`
and `arrival-body-after-2026-10-02` are the same corpus either side of that
clause, every figure noise; no reading on either side names a killer or
invents another cause, so the clause measured harmless rather than helpful
here. The after set is `Eval::Arrival::BASELINE`.

**The room reacting to the arrival** is its own corpus on the same bench,
`CORPUS=reactions` on `eval:arrival` and `eval:arrival_digest`
(`Eval::Arrival::Reactions`, `test/fixtures/files/arrival_reactions_corpus.json`):
the staged arrival with the rows the engine's reactions step writes held on
it, so the request carries its "## As You Come In" block. Its kept set is
`arrival-reactions-2026-09-28`, whose README reads each reaction by hand; the
arrival corpus and its kept set are untouched by it. The main prompt corpus's
move cases do walk into rooms where somebody reacts, so `prompt-2026-09-28-reactions`
replaced `prompt-2026-09-28` as the main prompt baseline.

## Conditional narrator moments

`CORPUS=branches` stages the pending moments in
`test/fixtures/files/prompt_branches_corpus.yml`. `Eval::Prompt::Branches::Stage`
uses the Ruby loop's record writers and seeded picks, then asks the narrator
once, with the engine's request for that moment. This producer instrument deliberately does not run an additional game
turn: an attack is already a blow, and these cases ask about records awaiting
prose. The main and ending corpora retain their identities and kept files.
The main request baseline was refreshed separately by `ta-bench-rebaseline-stale`;
these branch cases retain their own measured set. This instrument changes no
production prompt, schema, engine or seed content.

```bash
bin/rails ruby_llm:load_models
bin/rails eval:estimate
bin/rails eval:prompt CORPUS=branches MODELS=mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1 SET=my-branches
bin/rails eval:prompt_score SET=my-branches
bin/rails eval:prompt_board SETS=my-branches
bin/rails eval:prompt_compare BEFORE=prompt-branches-body-after-2026-10-02 AFTER=my-branches
bin/rails eval:prompt_digest CORPUS=branches SET=prompt-branches-body-after-2026-10-02
```

The `dead_body_later` case is a body inspected once the fight that killed it
has closed and slid into the recap, where only the body's own dead line still
says who killed it. `prompt-branches-body-before-2026-10-02` and
`prompt-branches-body-after-2026-10-02` are the same corpus either side of that
line, every check noise. Read by hand, two of the four before readings of that
case invent a cause ("whatever dragged him", "the iron gate's teeth"); after,
two name the player's blow and none invents another. The after set is
`Eval::Prompt::Branches::BASELINE`.

The lowest case ID in each shape designates the assembled request. Its system
message, user message and null streaming schema form a versioned
`request_identity`, using the shared `Eval::RequestIdentity` format. Kept-set
tests reconstruct these requests offline and compare them with every paid
repetition. The full readings survive in the kept set, including placed facts,
raw prose, prompts and token receipts; the warm-up has its own receipt and is
excluded from the figures. The evidence directory's `receipts.rb` recomputes the
purchase total from retained tokens and the prices recorded before buying.

The added predicates detect bounded explicit contradictions of blows, tolls,
throws, HP/life/death and the next quest beat, alongside the existing generic
checks where judgeable. They abstain on quoted, hypothetical and negated clauses.
Exact future-summary leakage is detectable; paraphrased leaks are not. Missing
acknowledgement is not counted as a contradiction. The predicate tests retain
clean controls and contradictory examples; a clean rate does not establish
semantic truthfulness.

Each branch reading has nullable `human.truthfulness`, `human.next_beat_fit`
and `human.quality` fields. Unlabelled truthfulness appears as **unlabelled
(human-only)** on the board, never as a clean score. A human may label
truthfulness true/false and retain fit/quality judgements in those fields;
truthfulness beyond the placed explicit facts, natural fit of a beat, geometry
semantics and overall quality remain human-only. There is no new lab page.
