# What is wrong with a story, in sentences a person can act on.
#
# A world here outlives the schema that made it. `rake game:new` writes records
# that stay in the database while features land around them, so a story
# generated before opening arrivals existed still sits next to one generated
# after, and the difference only shows up when somebody tries to play it --
# usually as a stack trace, mid-turn, which is the least useful possible form
# for it to take.
#
# So this asks the questions the play path asks, ahead of the play path, and
# answers them in English. EVERY CHECK MIRRORS SOMETHING REAL: the comment on
# each one names the code that would otherwise be the first to notice. When
# that code changes, the check changes with it -- a doctor that reports on a
# precondition the game no longer has is worse than no doctor.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do is decide anything. It reports; `Story::Repair`
# acts on what it reports, and only on the findings whose remedy is honest.
class Story::Doctor
  # `fatal` means the story cannot be played at all -- `PlaythroughsController`
  # refuses it, or the first turn raises. `warning` means it opens and something
  # in it is still wrong.

  #            which costs a call and an API key, so it is opt-in.
  #   manual   there is no honest answer. Backfilling it would mean inventing
  #            world data to make a validation pass, and this never does that.

  # there saw no such thing. That is the phantom event the captain read, and
  # his own Mournwell Lane carries it.
  #
  # WHAT IS PROVABLE HERE IS THE PAIR, NOT THE COUNT, and that distinction is
  # the whole check. A mobile room's arity is NOT the file's on a played world:

  # realized, so the captain's lane legitimately leads onto two anchored places
  # the file never mentioned. What the file can prove is that the doorway it

  # after a night has run means something wrote it back, and the only thing that
  # writes an edge from a file is a re-seed.
  #
  # THE LIMIT, STATED. A permutation may legitimately land the file's own
  # endpoint back on the room, and nothing on record tells that from a re-seed.
  # It is reported anyway, because the cost of being wrong is one doorway
  # closing on a world that moves its doorways every night, and it is only ever
  # reported for a room that leads SEVERAL ways into the fixed city -- a room

  # player can never speak to, however central they are to the world. That is
  # the defect this column was added for -- The Tide Post recorded the
  # protagonist alone in a world about a man chained to it -- and this is the
  # sweep that finds the rest of them.
  #
  # NOWHERE ON PURPOSE IS NOT ONE OF THEM. `characters.deliberately_absent` is a
  # world's own statement that somebody has been removed from it, and the three
  # checks that read it (`#characters_nowhere`, `#characters_absent_in_the_seed`,
  # `#characters_absent_but_somewhere`) exist so that this sweep reports the
  # accidental nowhere and stays silent about the deliberate one. It reported
  # `The Unrecorded Hour` on every single run before the marker existed.
  #
  # THE PARTY IS NOT ASKED ABOUT. The protagonist and anyone `is_companion`
  # travel with the playthrough (`playthroughs.current_location_id`), because
  # two people playing one world stand in two rooms at once. A story-level
  # column cannot hold that, so nowhere is the CORRECT state for them and
  # reporting it would be reporting the design.

  # written by a seed file, by hand, or by an earlier build of the app are
  # under no rule at all, and the first thing that notices is the classifier
  # resolving one word two ways mid-turn.
  #
  # EVERY ONE OF THEM NAMES ITS LAYER, and since the captain's ruling of
  # 2026-09-04 that is the first thing the reader needs. THE WORLD'S OWN ROWS
  # are what the caps bound, what two of a name is a collision in, and what a
  # seed file writes; ONE PLAYTHROUGH'S OWN COPIES are that game's progress, and
  # two of a name across two games is not a collision at all -- no closed set
  # ever offers a party anything but its own. So the caps, the duplicates and
  # the name collisions ask about templates, and the two findings below them ask
  # about copies. `Item#whereabouts` says which layer a row is in, so a message
  # that prints it cannot be read against the wrong one.
  #
  # Duplicates and collisions are `manual`: which of two things called "the

  # acts out of `Playthrough::Volition::Weights::NO_PURSUIT`: they mostly stand
  # still. That is a working world and the reason none of this is `fatal`. What
  # it is not is the world anybody wrote: it is every character written before
  # the columns existed, and the finding is how they are found.
  #
  # REPORTED SEPARATELY FROM THE STAT BLOCK AND THE ABILITIES, and for exactly
  # the reason those two are separate from each other: `Character#desires?` is
  # its own predicate, the facts do not merge, and a finding that reported a
  # missing want under the heading "stat block" would send a reader to the
  # wrong table.
  #
  # `:generate` AND NOT `:safe`, WHICH IS WHERE THIS PARTS COMPANY WITH
  # `#stat_blocks` ABOVE, and it is worth saying why because the two findings
  # otherwise look alike. A hit die is `:safe` because the ENGINE is the sole
  # author of that number and the roll is the only thing that was ever going to
  # decide it -- rolling one is not inventing world data. A conscious desire is
  # the opposite case: nothing on record implies one, no die can produce one,
  # and the only author there has ever been is a model. Writing one costs a
  # call and an API key, which is exactly what `REMEDIES` means by `generate`
  # and exactly why the backfill is `rake game:backfill_desires` rather than a
  # step in `Update::REGISTRY` -- `Update::Step.model_calls?` forbids a
  # post-update step that makes one.
  #
  # THE FOUR AND NOT THE SIX. `#pursuits?` is the engine's half and is silent
  # here on purpose: a world file is allowed to hand somebody a label with no
  # prose behind it, and the two labels are how a world opts into
  # `Playthrough::Volition` at all rather than something every world owes.
  #
  # AND IT IS SILENT FOR A WORLD THAT HAS NOT STARTED, which is the half that
  # keeps this check honest under the doctor's own contract -- *every check
  # mirrors a precondition the play path really has*. Since somebody with no
  # pursuit simply never acts (`Playthrough::Volition::Weights.row_for`), a
  # world where NOBODY has desires has no precondition broken: it is every
  # world written before the columns existed, and it plays exactly as it always
  # did. What is really wrong is a world HALFWAY -- some of the cast written
  # and some left out, which is what a backfill that partly failed leaves
  # behind, and what makes one room's people act while the next room's stand
  # there. `rake game:backfill_desires` is the instrument for the other case:
  # its dry run lists everybody who has none, for every story, and costs

  #
  # EVERY WAY A LAYOUT CAN BE WRONG, and every one of them is a WARNING with a
  # MANUAL remedy. Both halves are choices and both are worth saying out loud.
  #
  # WARNING RATHER THAN FATAL, because `fatal` in this file means one thing --
  # `PlaythroughsController` refuses the story, or the first turn raises -- and
  # no coordinate can cause either. A story with two rooms on top of each other
  # opens and plays exactly as it did before; what is wrong with it is its map.
  # The play path DOES read a box now -- `Location::Plan` states the room's
  # dimensions to the room writer and to the narrator -- so the room whose box
  # is wrong reads wrong, and that is still not a room that cannot be entered.
  #
  # MANUAL RATHER THAN SAFE, which is `rooms_with_an_unknown_danger`'s argument
  # applied to five columns instead of one: THERE IS NO DERIVABLE ANSWER and
  # clearing a column is not a neutral act. Moving one of two overlapping rooms
  # means deciding which of them its author put in the wrong place -- nothing on
  # record says. Clearing a box to resolve an orphan deletes a floor plan
  # somebody laid out; giving its parent a footprint invents one. Filling in the
  # two numbers a partial box is missing invents a room's size. Every one of
  # those is exactly what this tool's own rule forbids: backfilling world data to
  # make a check pass. Deciding how wide a room is whose author wrote zero is the
  # same act, and so is breaking one link of a ring of places that contain each
  # other -- which of them its author meant to be the outermost is not on record.
  # A person edits the world file and re-seeds.
  #
  # THE LAST FIVE ARE ABOUT A LAYOUT AS A WHOLE rather than about one row, and
  # they arrived with the thing that writes one (`Location::Interior`). Until
  # something laid an interior out, a rule about how a layout FITS TOGETHER was
  # a rule with no author to hold to it; now there is one, and these are the
  # statements it makes that a database could contradict -- a room outside the
  # building it is a room of, a room nothing can walk to, a stair that does not
  # arrive where it set off from, a door standing in no wall, and a place
  # written out in full with nothing inside it at all.
  # --- THE ARC ---------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # THE CAPTAIN'S FIVE PROPERTIES OF *"playable in a reasonable way"*, 2026-09-06,
  # four of which are questions about records this class already walks. His
  # fifth -- the world has somebody in it to talk to -- is `ta-room-people-count`
  # and is not here.
  #
  #   P1  THE GOAL EXISTS AS A ROW before the player can run out of frontier.
  #       `#unbound_quest_steps` and `#stories_that_cannot_progress`.
  #   P2  THE FRONTIER KEEPS POINTING AT THE GOAL -- not every unexplored exit
  #       leads away from it. `#frontier_turned_away_from_the_goal`.
  #   P3  THE ARC CAN COMPLETE -- every bound step is reachable from the opening
  #       room. `#unreachable_quest_targets`, and it is FATAL.
  #   P4  THE ENDING IS WRITTEN -- there is an outcome row to reach.
  #       `#quests_without_an_outcome`.
  #
  # WHY TWO OF THEM ARE FATAL when nothing here stops a turn from running. The
  # doctor's own rule is that fatal means the story cannot be PLAYED, and an arc
  # never gates a line -- but the captain's Call 1 of 2026-09-06 chose *always
  # completable*, and a world that cannot deliver its own ending is a world the
  # index page should not offer.
  #
  # A WORLD WITH NO ARC AT ALL gets one finding and none of the rest, because
  # every property above is vacuously true of an arc that is not there. It used

  # *"b -- wait for the floor index"*, and the whole reason the arc waited for
  # the geometry programme.
  #
  # WHAT HE ACTUALLY HIT. At the moment story 7 dead-ended, the world was
  # topologically healthy: it still had unexplored rooms and every one of them
  # was reachable. They just all led UP AND OUT -- `tunnel upward`, then the
  # surface, then a capital city *"a long journey away"* -- in a story about
  # going down. A frontier COUNT cannot tell "one unexplored room" from "one
  # unexplored room in the wrong direction", and `The Salt Assizes` has exactly
  # the same count and is fine.
  #
  # AND HOPS CANNOT TELL THEM APART EITHER, which is worth writing down because
  # the first design of this check tried: once the goal is a bound row and is
  # reachable, some unexplored room always lies on a shortest path to it, so
  # *"every unexplored exit increases the distance to the goal"* can never be
  # true. Distance-to-goal collapses into `#unreachable_quest_targets`, which is
  # already fatal about it. Measured on his own world, graph depth puts
  # Blackfang Tunnel and `surface` BOTH two hops from the opening room -- the
  # bottom of the dungeon and the way out of it, tied.
  #
  # SO IT IS `z`, WHICH CANNOT TIE. The goal stands deeper than every unexplored
  # room in the world: nothing anybody can still open leads down toward it, and
  # the only way on is back through rooms already walked. A WARNING and not
  # fatal, deliberately -- the goal is reachable, so the world is completable;
  # what is wrong is that exploring has stopped being the way to it, which is a
  # thing to know rather than a thing that stops a game.
  #
  # WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, in this class's habit of writing it down: a FLAT world.

  # containment level up. `Location::Spot` owns what a position IS.
  #
  # WARNING AND MANUAL, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HERE, and for this section's own
  # two reasons. Nothing in the play path reads a coordinate, so a thing in the
  # wrong half of a room breaks nobody's game -- and there is no derivable
  # answer: when a row says it is somewhere its room is not, WHICH of the two
  # records is wrong is not on the records. Clearing the position throws away a
  # placement somebody made; moving it into the box invents a cell nobody chose;
  # giving the room a box invents a floor plan. A person edits the world file
  # and re-seeds.
  #
  # BOTH TABLES IN ONE FINDING EACH, rather than three findings per table: the
  # fault is the same fault whether the row is a chair or a clerk, and a reader
  # sent looking for "a thing outside its room" should not have to know which of
  # two codes to grep for. `#positioned_rows` is the one query they share.

  # HALF A POSITION: an `x` and no `y`, or the other way round.
  # `Item#a_position_is_whole` and `Character#a_position_is_whole` refuse one and
  # `WorldSeed::Loader#validate_positions!` refuses a file that writes one, so a
