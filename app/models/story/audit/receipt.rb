# WHAT A SCENE'S ENGINE RECEIPT SAYS, read back out of the exact words the
# engine wrote into `Scene#engine_fact`.
#
# THE RECEIPT IS THE RECORD AND THIS ONLY READS IT. `Scene#engine_fact` holds
# the sentences the app supplied to a scene's prose writer, frozen at the moment
# it wrote them -- `Scene::ArrivalContext#facts` on a playthrough arrival,
# `Playthrough::NpcAction#apply!` on a conversation. Both are fixed templates,
# so a line either has one of the shapes below or it says nothing this class
# can read. Nothing here reconstructs a receipt from rows that may have moved
# since, which is the whole reason the column exists.
#
# WHAT IT READS, and only lines a check here needs:
#
#   Dead here: A, B. They cannot speak or act.     -> #dead
#   Dead here: A, killed by C 5 minutes ago; B. ... -> #dead
#   Also here: A, B. Nobody else is alive here.    -> #living
#   Lying here: a, b.                              -> #lying
#   You are carrying: a, b.                        -> #carried
#   <name> changes no possessions, travel ...      -> #possessions_unchanged?
#   The proposed action was rejected: ... changed. -> #possessions_unchanged?
#   ... it BROKE ...                               -> #broke?
#
# AND IT HOLDS THE COMPARISON, so there is one reading of a receipt against a
# passage: `Story::Audit#check_receipt` turns `#contradictions` into flags, and
# `Story::Audit::ReceiptTest` measures the same method over stored evaluation
# sets that have no database behind them. A measurement that re-implemented the
# comparison would be measuring a second reading that could drift from this one.
#
# A NAME IS SPLIT ON ", " because that is how the writers join a list. A name
# that itself holds ", " is read as two, and the halves are then scanned for as
# names of their own; no name in a checked-in world holds one. The readers
# are pinned to the writers in `Story::Audit::ReceiptTest`, which builds each
# receipt through the real writer rather than copying its words.
