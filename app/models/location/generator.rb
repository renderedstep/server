  # THE INSIDE OF A PLACE, ON FIRST ENTRY. The captain's first ruling of
  # 2026-09-06 -- *the whole interior is laid out on first entry, rooms realized
  # lazily* -- and this is the seam it is triggered through: realizing a stub IS
  # a player arriving somewhere for the first time, and it is the one moment in
  # the app that already means that.
  #
  # `Location#place?` IS THE WHOLE OF THE DECISION, and it is narrow on purpose.
  # It is true only of a row that already carries a FOOTPRINT, which a seed file
  # writes and `.create_stub!` writes for an exit picked with a band of several
  # rooms. A stub picked `one room` carries none and answers false, so it is
  # realized as the room it is and never split into a single child that fills it.
  # WHICH stubs become places is decided where the footprint is written, and not
  # here.
  #
  # BEFORE THE FLIP TO `realized`, in the detail checkpoint's transaction.
  # A layout that raises rolls back every admission and leaves its paid answer
  # available for the next entry to finish. The final exits checkpoint is what
  # exposes the completed place as realized. `Story::Doctor`'s
  # `place_with_a_footprint_and_no_rooms` reports the state anyway, because a
  # database can carry one this code did not write.
  #
  # IT USED TO RUN AFTER THE EXITS CALL, so that the model would not be handed
  # this place's own rooms as somewhere to open a door to. That ordering is no
  # longer what carries the rule and was never strong enough to: a room is now
  # neither OFFERED (`#known_location_names` takes the placed rooms of other
  # places off the list) nor ACCEPTED (`#connect_exit!` refuses one outright),
  # whenever the rooms happen to have been written. A rule about who may be a
  # neighbour holds in an order a rule about which call comes first does not.
  #
  # AND THE ROOMS ARE WIRED TO THIS PLACE'S OWN EXITS, in the same transaction
  # -- #open_the_way_in!, which is the captain's Call 5 of 2026-09-07. The
  # layout has to exist before anything can send anybody into it, so this is the
  # one moment both halves are on the records at once: the doorways the place
  # arrived with, and the rooms they should have been landing on.
  #
  # AN ALREADY-REALIZED PLACE IS NEVER LAID OUT, because `#realize!` returns one
  # untouched -- the "generate once per place" guarantee, which this is downhill
  # of rather than an exception to.
  #
  # AND A PLACE THAT ALREADY HAS ROOMS IS NEVER LAID OUT EITHER, which is the
  # guard that matters to a world file and is `Location::Interior#lay_out!`'s
  # rather than this method's: a file may ship a place as a STUB and still draw
  # every room inside it by hand, so `#place?` is true of it and it is handed
  # over -- and handed straight back, because the rooms are on the records.
  # `test/fixtures/files/a-world-with-an-interior.yml` is exactly that shape,

  # schema in the app that is not a constant. The captain's ruling of 2026-09-07:
  # the narrator picks how populated a place is and the engine rolls the count
  # inside that word's band, so `Location::DetailSchema.for_people` requires
  # exactly as many people as `#people_instructions` asks for and the sentence and
  # the field cannot disagree. A BUILDING IS ASKED FOR NO PEOPLE AT ALL -- nobody
  # ever stands in a container -- so the pick reaches rooms and never places, and
  # this branch is where that is true.

  # THE WAY IN, MOVED OFF THE BUILDING AND ONTO A ROOM OF IT.
  #
  # THE CAPTAIN'S CALL 5, 2026-09-07: *"the neighbour's doorway lands on the
  # entry room, and the place row is never an endpoint."* Until this method
  # nothing in the app wired a place's doorway to a room inside it, and the one
  # world in the repository with a building had its way in written by hand.
  #
  # WHY IT IS A TRANSPLANT AND NOT A RULE AT WRITING TIME. The doorway is
  # written when a NEIGHBOUR names this place -- long before anybody opens it,
  # when it has no rooms to land on. So the edge is correct when it is written
  # (it is the way in, waiting: `Location#laid_out?`) and becomes wrong the
  # instant there is an inside, which is here. Refusing the edge at #connect_exit!
  # instead would be refusing to let a model name a building.
  #
  # THE LABEL IS CARRIED OVER, NEVER RE-DERIVED. An exterior edge keeps its
  # label -- `Location::Interior`'s two travel-time rules, and the reason is that
  # there is no geometry to derive one from: the quay and the counting room
  # stand in different planes (`Location::Box`). So the distance and the travel
  # method a model picked for "the way to The Rusted Anchor" are the distance
  # and travel method of the way to its taproom.
  #
  # A DOOR IS TWO ROWS, so the pair is dropped and the pair is rewritten, and
  # #connect! is what writes them -- the same writer, the same direction-neutral
  # values, no second spelling of what a doorway is.
  #
  # WHERE IT LANDS WHEN THE ENTRY ROOM IS FULL: the next ground-floor room with
  # a slot (`Location::Interior.doorstep`), because a place can be named by more
  # than one neighbour before anybody opens it and the layout keeps exactly ONE
  # slot free. A second street door on a second ground-floor room is an ordinary
  # building.
  #
  # AND A DOORWAY WITH NOWHERE LEFT TO LAND IS DROPPED, which is the honest
  # answer rather than the tidy one. The alternative is leaving it on the place
  # row, and that is the one shape this whole method exists to make impossible:
  # a party standing in a container, its rooms reachable from nowhere. A
  # building nothing can reach is `Story::Doctor`'s to report
  # (`place_reachable_only_from_inside`) and the neighbour keeps every other way
  # out it had.

  # room inside another place, or a neighbour already at its own cap, is a name
  # #connect_exit! cannot honour on any pass -- taking it would break an
  # invariant rather than bend a preference. So a room every one of whose named
  # ways out was one of those still ends with none, and that is the state
  # `Story::Doctor` reports and `Story::Repair` finishes by calling this again.
  #
  # AN INTERIOR ROOM'S WAYS OUT ARE THE ENGINE'S, AND THE CALL IS NOT MADE.
  # `Location::Interior` already decided every door and every stair a room has,
  # from geometry and one seeded roll, under guarantees no prompt can carry:
  # every room reachable from the entry, no room past
  # `Location::ExitsSchema::MAX_EXITS`, a door only between two rooms that share
  # a WALL, a stair only between two rooms that stand over each other, and one
  # slot kept free on the entry room for the way IN. Every exit a model could
  # name here breaks one of those. A sibling that meets this room at a corner is
  # a door through a corner (`Location::Box#shares_a_wall?` is false and
  # `Story::Doctor`'s `door_between_rooms_that_share_no_wall` reports one). An
  # invented name is worse: `.create_stub!` writes no `parent_location`, so it
  # would be a row at the OUTERMOST level wired to a room two doors deep inside
  # a building -- a shape nothing in the app can produce and nothing downstream
  # reads. And either one spends the entry room's reserved slot on somebody
  # else's door.
  #
  # SKIPPED RATHER THAN ANSWERED-AND-IGNORED, which is the choice between the
  # two and the reason this is here rather than a refusal in #connect_exit!: an
  # answer that would be thrown away whole is an answer that should not be
  # bought, so this saves the model call and not just the writes. NO PROMPT TEXT
  # MOVES either way -- the exits prompt is not BUILT for a room, rather than
  # built differently for one, so nothing a baseline was measured on changes.
  #
  # SO A ROOM CAN END WITH NO WAY OUT AT ALL, and the single room of a one-room
  # interior does until slice 4 wires the way in. `Story::Doctor` reports it as
  # `location_has_no_exits` and `Story::Repair` calls this and is told nothing
  # was written, which is the honest answer: the way into a building is not a
  # thing a model may name.
  # AND A PLACE THAT HAS AN INSIDE IS NOT ASKED EITHER, for the mirror image of
  # the reason a room of one is not. A laid-out place's ways out ARE its rooms'
  # ways out -- #open_the_way_in! has just moved every doorway it had onto the
  # entry room, on the captain's Call 5 that the place row is never an endpoint
  # -- so an exit named here would be a door back onto the container, written by
  # the very call that runs a line after the transplant. `Story::Doctor` reports
  # one (`connection_terminating_on_a_place`); this is what stops the app

  # label on a door this room was actually writing (`UnusableExitLabel`, raised
  # by #connect!). The transaction rolls the graph back, the answer is dropped,

  # checkpoint is untouched. EVERY OTHER FAILURE KEEPS THE ANSWER, because the
  # same answer can be applied by a retry that costs no model call: a lost
  # connection, a busy database, a finalization that raised.
  #
  # WHICH DOORS GET WRITTEN IS NOT PREDICTED HERE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE RULE.
  # The writer is sequential -- #connect_exit! judges a proposal against the
  # records as they stand when it reaches it, this room's allowance included,
  # and #connect! writes nothing at all for a pair that already exists -- so a
  # label is judged at the one moment its own row is about to be created and
  # never before. A second reading of that policy, run over the whole answer
  # against the graph as it was, refused proposals the writer then dropped and
  # failed realizations the player had already paid for: a way back named again
  # with a bad label, a written neighbour this room cannot open onto, a second

      - Pick its use_kind from the supplied physical profiles. Ordinary is the
        default. Food and drink can be consumed without healing; healing is only
        a restorative dose this world permits. Firestarters burn combustible
        objects, levers pry jammed passages, lockpicks try locks, and a key only
        opens a passage explicitly matched to it. Mark combustible only when an
        ordinary firestarter can destroy the object. The engine owns the effects
        and their amounts; its description cannot grant extra powers
      - If a thing has WRITING on it -- a note, a letter, a handbill, a label, a
        docket, a page, a sign -- mark it readable and WRITE OUT WHAT IS WRITTEN
        ON IT, exactly as it appears on the thing. The words themselves, not a
        description of them, and short enough to finish -- a few words, a line,
        or a few short lines. The game keeps those words and a player reading it

      ## Places That Already Exist In This Story
      Reuse a name from this list when an exit leads somewhere already known.
      Only invent a name when the exit leads somewhere genuinely new.
      A place marked (already written) has had its own ways out written down
      already, so naming it here would open a door it does not have: leave it
      out and name somewhere new instead.
      #{known_location_names.presence || "None yet."}

      ## Instructions
      - Name AT MOST #{room_for_exits} #{"way".pluralize(room_for_exits)} out. That is what is left of this
        room's #{Location::ExitsSchema::MAX_EXITS}, not a target: fewer is a better answer than a door
        nobody needed
      - Each exit is somewhere the player can reach directly from #{location.name}
      - One way out is a complete answer. A dead end, a cell, the bottom of a
        shaft: if the only way out is back the place the player came from, list
        that place and nothing else. Never invent a passage to reach a second
      - When there is more than one, give the player a reason to prefer one
        over another
      - Do not list #{location.name} itself
      - Say which of them have an INSIDE, and say NO INSIDE for almost all of
        them. Saying anything else makes the game build a whole floor plan of
        rooms in that place and send the player walking through them, so it is
        only ever right for a BUILDING somebody goes in at a door -- an inn, a
        keep, a counting house, a warren. A road, a shore, a clearing, a bridge,
        a square, a cave mouth, a stair, a courtyard: no inside. A room, an
        office, a hall, a chamber: no inside either, because those are already
        somewhere the player stands. Where it really is a building, pick the size
        it would really be rather than the most interesting one
      - Distance and travel method must be consistent with the description you
        just wrote, and must be true in both directions -- the way back is the
        same edge
      - Say how populated each place is, in one of the words offered. A place is
        peopled by what it is FOR: a market, a taproom, a guardhouse, a
        workshop, a shrine somebody keeps -- somewhere with a reason for
        somebody to be standing in it. A place is empty when nothing is asked of
        anybody there: a cellar, a back stair, a stretch of road, a room that is
        locked, a place the story has already emptied. Neither answer is the
        safe one

  # so nothing may rest on it: `Quest::Deadline` is the verify half and it does
  # not care whether this worked. A world where the model never once takes the
  # hint still reaches its own ending; what this buys is that it reaches it as
  # fiction rather than as an engine placement.
  #
  # ONE BLOCK AND NOT THREE, which is what makes it cost nothing per room.
  # `#story_context` is sent by BOTH realization calls -- the detail call and
  # the exits call share one `BaseAgent` conversation -- so a single block
  # reaches the seam that names a way out, the seam that writes a person into a
  # room, and the seam that puts a thing on the floor. There is no second call
  # and no per-seam prompt.
  #
  # IT NAMES THE NEXT OPEN STEP AND NOT THE ARC. Three or four beats would be an
  # outline, and `Story::Generator`'s closing sentence -- *"Leave the ending
  # open. You are starting a story, not outlining one."* -- is a rule about this
  # world that a later call must not quietly reverse.
  #
  # AND IT NEVER CARRIES THE CONCLUSION, which is where this departs from the
  # arc design's own draft (`data/ta-quest-progress-scout/report.md` §5.3 puts a
  # `conclusion:` line in this block). The captain's Call 4 of 2026-09-06 gave
  # the reasoning against it one prompt over: a model told how the story ends
  # writes TOWARD that ending, and a room described as though the ending were
  # near is prose about a record the engine does not have. The step is a fact --
  # the world must come to contain this thing -- and the ending is not one yet.
  #
  # THE STEP IS THE MAIN ARC'S FIRST UNREACHED ONE, asked WITHOUT a playthrough:
  # realization is the WORLD growing, not one player's progress through it, and
  # two people playing one world must not get two different rooms. So it is the
  # arc's own first open beat rather than `Playthrough::Arc#next_step`'s
  # per-game answer, and that is the one place in the app where the two
  # deliberately differ.
  #
  # EMPTY FOR EVERY WORLD WITH NO ARC, which is every world generated before
  # `Quest::Generator` shipped and every seed file with no `quests:` block -- so
  # those worlds send the prompt they always sent, byte for byte, and the stored

  # KEYED ON PLACEMENT AND NOT ON `parent_location_id` EQUALITY, and the
  # difference is a shape a world file may legitimately write: PLAIN
  # CONTAINMENT, a `parent` with no box -- a district a street sits in, which
  # `WorldSeed::Loader#validate_one_parent!` allows and `WorldSeed::Exporter`

  # equality instead, a street inside a district would be offered nothing but
  # the district's other streets -- "None yet." for the only child of one -- and
  # would then be refused every outermost name it reused, which is a realized
  # room with no way out of it.
  #
  # THIS IS NOT A PROMPT CHANGE WANTING A STORED BASELINE, and it is worth
  # saying so here so nobody later reads it as one. Nothing in the app wrote a
  # `parent_location` before `Location::Interior` did, and no world any stored

  # An exit becomes a stub neighbour plus a connection in both directions.
  # Reusing an existing location by name is what stops realizing A -> stub B,
  # then realizing B, from creating a second A alongside the first.
  #
  # A REUSED NAME THAT IS ALREADY WRITTEN IS NOT A NEW EXIT. Realizing this
  # room would otherwise add a way out to a room whose description has already
  # been written and already said what its ways out are: a supply closet whose
  # prose reads "there is no other door" grew a second one the moment the
  # hallway next to it was realized and the model reused the closet's name. The
  # edge is dropped in BOTH directions, because it is one edge.
  #
  # What decides is the connection and not the detail level, so the two cases
  # that have to stay legal do: the way back, written when this room was still
  # a stub, and a written place the player can already reach from here. Only an
  # edge that did not exist before is refused. `into_written:` is the floor in
  # #write_exits! asking for that refusal to be lifted.
  #
  # A DOOR NEVER CROSSES THE WALL OF A BUILDING, and it takes BOTH this method
  # and #write_exits! to mean that -- neither half is the whole rule, and a
  # reader who trusts one of them alone will be wrong.
  #
  # THIS HALF IS THE WAY IN: a name that RESOLVES to a PLACED ROOM of some other
  # place is refused, so an exterior exit never lands inside a building somebody
  # laid out. Three things go wrong at once without it, and only the first is
  # cosmetic: the party walks off a street straight into somebody's back room,
  # which is slice 4's decision to make and not a model's; the entry room's
  # spare exit -- the slot `Location::Interior` keeps free for the way IN -- is
  # spent on a door somewhere else; and a room already carrying its full
  # `Location::ExitsSchema::MAX_EXITS` takes one more, which
  # `EngineSweep::Invariants#exit_cap` fails a walk for. THE NAME IS DROPPED
  # WHOLE and no stub is created under it: a second location called what a room
  # is already called is the duplicate #find_location exists to prevent.
  #
  # THE OTHER HALF IS THE WAY OUT, AND THIS CHECK CANNOT MAKE IT. A name that
  # does NOT resolve becomes a stub, and `.create_stub!` writes no
  # `parent_location` at all -- every invented neighbour is born at the
  # outermost level, so nothing here could tell a door out of a room from a door
  # between two streets. What holds instead is #write_exits!, which asks for no
  # exits at all for a placed room of a laid-out interior: those rooms' doors
  # are `Location::Interior`'s, decided before anybody typed a line. For
  # everything else an outermost stub is the RIGHT neighbour -- an outermost
  # place opens onto an outermost place, and a street inside a district that
  # opens onto somewhere outside the district is a street you can leave the
  # district by.
  #
  # PLACEMENT, NOT `parent_location_id` EQUALITY, is what both halves are keyed
  # on, and `#known_location_names` says why at length: PLAIN CONTAINMENT -- a
  # `parent` with no box, which a world file may write -- is not an interior and
  # is not gated as one. Keyed on parent equality this would refuse a street
  # inside a district every outermost name it reused and leave it realized with
  # no way out.
  #
  # BOTH ENDS HAVE THE BUDGET, checked here rather than in #connect! because A
  # DOOR IS TWO ROWS and a per-direction check would write one of them -- the
  # first row spends this location's allowance, so the second call would find it
  # gone and leave a one-way door behind.
  # AND A NAME THAT RESOLVES TO A BUILDING SOMEBODY HAS ALREADY OPENED IS
  # RESOLVED ONE STEP FURTHER, to the room its way in lands on. The captain's
  # Call 5 of 2026-09-07 said as a rule about writing rather than as one about
  # repair: a model may name a place -- that is what a place is FOR -- and the
  # engine decides that naming a building means opening a door onto a room of
  # it. #open_the_way_in! is the same rule applied to the doorways a place
  # already had; this is it applied to the next one.
  #
  # AND `#room_elsewhere?` IS ASKED FIRST, OF THE NAME AS WRITTEN, which is what
  # keeps the two rules from cancelling each other out. That check refuses a
  # name that resolves to a PLACED ROOM of another building -- a room a model
  # chose -- and a place is not one, so a building passes it and is then
  # resolved. Resolving first would hand the check the entry room and it would
  # refuse the very door this paragraph exists to open.
  #
  # A PLACE NOBODY HAS OPENED RESOLVES TO ITSELF (`Location::Interior.way_in`),
  # because it has no rooms yet -- the doorway onto it is the way in, waiting,
  # and #open_the_way_in! moves it the moment there is somewhere for it to go.
  #
  # AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE GATES IS ASKED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE, on the records
  # as they stand when this proposal is reached rather than as they stood when
  # the answer arrived. `#write_exits_serially!` says at length why nothing
  # predicts this method's verdict ahead of it.

  # THE TREE. Not a second reading of "the same name written differently"
  # written here: `WorldSeed.natural_key` is the repo's one spelling of that
  # question, `Story::Doctor#duplicate_locations` groups on it, and a generator
  # that resolved a name the doctor calls one thing to two rows would write the
  # defect the doctor exists to report -- in the same request, from the same
  # answer. The delegation is the guarantee that those two cannot drift.
  #
  # THE DEFECT IT CLOSES, proved offline with no model call (the captain's Call
  # 7 of 2026-09-08). `Location::ExitsSchema` asks for a name of "1 to 4 words,
  # no article" while the prompt lists the world's places AS STORED, articles
  # and all. So a world holding `The Causeway Court` is correctly answered
  # `Causeway Court`, an exact lowercased match missed it, and `#connect_exit!`
  # created a duplicate stub -- sometimes with a footprint and a whole floor
  # plan hung off it. This is a RECORD-MATCHING fix and deliberately not a
  # prompt one: the schema's wording and the prompt's list are what the exits
  # lab exists to measure, and nothing here may depend on a model spelling a
  # name the way the database happens to.
  #
  # AND IT GOES NO WIDER THAN `.natural_key` GOES. Case, runs of whitespace and
  # a leading article are not part of a name; punctuation, possessives and
  # plurals still are, so two genuinely different places stay two places. That
  # boundary is argued in `.natural_key`'s own header and the argument is
  # sharper here than at a seed file, because this side WRITES: folding two
  # names too eagerly does not duplicate a room, it silently hands one room's
  # doorways to another and there is no repair for that.
  #
  # PASS 3 -- the place-and-box reading -- never runs from here, because it
  # needs a seed document and this caller has none. Every name an exits answer
  # can carry is settled by the two written-name passes.
  # THIS ROOM NAMING ITSELF, and it is asked on `WorldSeed.natural_key` for the
  # same reason #find_location is. A plain `casecmp?` here was safe only while
  # the matcher below was also exact: once a name without its article resolves,
  # a room called `The Causeway Court` answering `Causeway Court` would resolve
  # to ITSELF and #connect! would write a door from the room to the room. The
  # two questions are one question -- "is this the same place?" -- so they read
  # the same key, and widening one without the other trades a duplicate row for
  # a self-loop.

  # A ROOM COMING INTO EXISTENCE, and the moment its danger is decided. The
  # captain's seventh ruling of 2026-09-04 evening: monster placement is a
  # rolled per-room parameter, *engine-rolled when the room is born*. A stub IS
  # a room being born -- it is created the moment a neighbour names it as an
  # exit, long before anybody walks in -- so the roll belongs here rather than
  # at realization, where it would depend on which order a player explored in.
  #
  # `Location::Danger.for_a_new_room` is the roll and it is seeded, so a world
  # regenerated from the same story at the same moment comes out the same way.
  # A SEEDED room is never rolled: `WorldSeed::Loader` writes what the file says
  # and an absent key is `Location::SAFE`, which is the rule every other seeded
  # parameter is under.
  # AND THE `inside` PICK IS WRITTEN HERE, AS A FOOTPRINT AND NOT AS A COLUMN OF
  # ITS OWN. `Location::Parameters::INSIDE` is the band each label names in paces
  # and the engine rolls both sides inside it, so `Location#place?` -- which is
  # `interior? && !placed?`, a footprint and no position -- answers true for a
  # generated stub with no new column and no new writer. ONLY A BAND OF SEVERAL
  # ROOMS WRITES ONE: `one room` is the named place itself and gets no footprint
  # (`Location::Parameters::ONE_ROOM`), because a place laid out as a single room
  # that fills it puts the player in "X room 1" instead of in X.
  #
  # ONLY A STUB BEING BORN, never a place that already exists: a footprint is a
  # world's parameter and this does not overrule one (`Location::Interior`'s
  # rule). `#connect_exit!` reaches here only when the name resolved to nothing.
  #
  # THE TWO FACTS AN ANSWER MAY CARRY ABOUT A PLACE IT IS NOT DESCRIBING ARE
  # SIMPLY HANDED ON -- `.create_stub!` is where a room being born is made, and
  # the footprint roll lives there so the lab and `Quest::Deadline` reach it
  # too. What is left here is why the exits call is the one asked.
  #
  # THE WORD FOR HOW POPULATED IT IS, IF THE ANSWER CARRIED ONE. The
  # captain's ruling of 2026-09-07 -- the narrator picks how populated a place is
  # from a closed list -- and this is the moment that pick is kept:
  # `Location::Population` needs the word before the room's OWN detail prompt is
  # built, and the only call with any reason to have an opinion about a place it
  # is not describing is the one naming the way there.
  #
  # IT IS A COLUMN WHERE `inside` IS A FOOTPRINT, and the difference is which
  # question the pick answers. A size can be spent immediately -- the engine rolls
  # paces and writes them, and nothing needs to remember the word. A population
  # word cannot: the count is rolled when somebody WALKS IN, which may be never,
  # so the word has to survive on the row until then.
  #
  # NOT VALIDATED HERE, and deliberately: `Location::Population.label_for` reads
  # the column and rolls a word for a row that has none, so a model that left the
  # field out or answered outside the enum leaves a stub the engine decides for.
  # `Location#population` refuses a word the table has no band for, which is the
  # verify half; sanitizing it to nil first would turn a wrong answer into a
  # failed save of the whole room.
  #
  # AND A NAME ANOTHER REALIZATION TOOK FIRST IS THAT PLACE. `#connect_exit!`
  # looks the name up before it gets here, and two realizations that both
  # missed would each create one; the unique index on `(story_id, lower(name))`
  # refuses the second, which then takes the row the first wrote.

  # direction-neutral; `time_to_travel` is derived there, not copied here.

  # created. A pair that already exists returns above and its labels are never
  # read at all, so a name the model spent on a door this room already has
  # cannot fail anything. A row that IS being written and does not validate
  # raises `UnusableExitLabel` -- the one failure #write_exits_serially! will
  # not keep a paid answer through. Anything the save itself raises is left as
  # itself: a uniqueness collision written by the far side's own generator is
  # not a bad label and does not cost this room its answer.
