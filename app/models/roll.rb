# THE DICE, AND THE SEED THEY ARE THROWN FROM.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL: *"A model cannot set an NPC's numbers, the engine rolls
# them"* -- the captain's ruling of 2026-09-04. Every number on a stat block is
# thrown here, so there is exactly one place in the app where a die is rolled
# and exactly one place a seed is built.
#
# DETERMINISM IS LOAD-BEARING, and the precedent is
# `WorldMechanic::ShuffleConnections`: the same turn has to roll the same die in
# any process, after any restart, for ever, or `rake game:sweep` cannot assert a
# number and `rake game:doctor` cannot re-derive one it repaired last week.
#
# NOTE WHAT IS NOT USED TO BUILD A SEED. `String#hash` and `Array#hash` are
# SALTED PER PROCESS in Ruby, so seeding from either would make the same roll
# come out differently after a restart -- the exact property this module exists
# to have. Every input is an integer and the arithmetic is plain, which is the
# rule `ShuffleConnections#seed_for` already keeps and the one thing about this
# file that must not be "simplified".
#
# WHAT A SEED IS MADE OF -- five integers, each of which answers a different
# "which roll is this":
#
#   story        which world. Two worlds do not share a die.
#   playthrough  which game, `0` when the roll belongs to the world itself
#                rather than to somebody playing it (a stat block is world data,
#                so the registry rolls with 0 and every game reads the same
#                person).
#   at           where the STORY's clock stood, in seconds. Story time, never
#                the wall clock -- a roll seeded from `Time.current` would come
#                out differently every time the same repair was rehearsed.
#   sequence     which roll within that moment. Two people born out of one room
#                realization are two rolls, and without this they would be one
#                number twice.
#   kind         WHICH SORT OF ROLL IT IS, and the fifth integer -- `0` unless a
#                caller says otherwise, so every die thrown before this existed
#                is unchanged.
#
# WHY `kind` EXISTS, and it is a defect written down rather than a nicety. Three
# sources carved `sequence` up between them by CONVENTION: `Playthrough::Turn#check`
# took 1..`Character::ABILITIES.size`, `Playthrough::Blow.next_sequence` counted
# UP from `SEQUENCE_OFFSET`, and `Playthrough::Toll.next_sequence` counted DOWN
# from -1 -- each unbounded, and between them the whole integer line. So the
# fourth source (a throw, whose identity is WHICH THING left your hands rather
# than a count of anything) had nowhere left to stand: it took the negative
# space too, and a game that had paid two tolls throwing item #3 seeded the
# lift and the hazard's save identically. Carving one axis finer would have hit
# the same wall again. An axis of its own cannot: two rolls of DIFFERENT kinds
# are different dice whatever either one counts, and a kind needs no agreement
# with anybody about bounds.
#
# A SEED IS BUILT FROM ROW IDS, AND A SWEEP PINS THE IDS RATHER THAN THE SEED.
# `rake game:sweep` walks a copy of a checked-in world, and the copy used to take
# whatever ids came next -- 1 in the empty test database, 4 once `db:seed` had
# loaded the checked-in worlds into a development one -- so the same script
# rolled different dice in the two and passed in one while failing in the other.
# The fix is `EngineSweep::Walk::ID_BASE`: every walk starts every table's ids at
# one number inside the transaction it rolls back, so the copy has the same ids
# wherever it is walked. REJECTED: seeding sweep rolls from a stable identity of
# the script instead. That would put a second way of building a seed into this
# file for one caller, would still leave every room, person and thing id that a
# roll keys on free to move, and would mean the sweep no longer threw the dice a
# real game throws. Pinning the ids changes nothing here, so no real
# playthrough's rolls move.
#
# THE PRIMES are odd and pairwise distinct so that the five inputs cannot cancel
# each other out: incrementing `sequence` by one and `at` by one must not land
# on the seed some other pair would.

  # THE KINDS OF ROLL THERE ARE, and `0` is *everything that carves `sequence`

  # A WHOLE INTERIOR, laid out from one seed (`Location::Interior`). Its
  # identity is WHICH PLACE, which is a location id -- and a location id is
  # already spoken for on the `sequence` axis by `Location::Danger`, which keys
  # a room's cast on `SEQUENCE_BASE + location.id`. Two rolls of different kinds
  # are different dice whatever either one counts, so a kind is what keeps the
  # shape of a building and the people in one of its rooms from being the same
  # number twice.
  INTERIOR = 2
  # WHERE IN A ROOM ONE THING IS, and WHERE IN A ROOM ONE PERSON IS
  # (`Location::Placement`). Their identity is WHICH ROW, which is an `items.id`
  # and a `characters.id` -- two different tables whose ids collide freely, so
  # one axis could not hold both and `sequence` could not tell an item #7 from a
  # person #7. TWO KINDS rather than one is what keeps the chair and the clerk
  # from being the same number twice.

  # HOW BIG A BUILDING IS, thrown once as its stub is written
  # (`Location::Generator#create_stub!`, from the `inside` band a model picked).
  # Its identity is WHICH PLACE, which is a location id -- and a location id is
  # already spoken for twice on the `sequence` axis, by `Location::Danger`'s cast
  # and by `INTERIOR`'s whole layout. A third kind is what keeps the footprint of
  # a building, the shape of its inside and the people in one of its rooms from
  # being the same number three times: the footprint is drawn BEFORE the layout
  # and decides what the layout has to divide, so a correlation between them
  # would be one roll deciding twice.
  FOOTPRINT = 5
  # HOW POPULATED A PLACE NOBODY PICKED A WORD FOR IS
  # (`Location::Population.label_for`). Its identity is WHICH PLACE, and -- alone
  # among the rolls in this app -- that is the place's NAME rather than its row:
  # a word is a fact about somewhere, a re-seeded world is the same somewhere,
  # and a row id is re-issued every time a world is loaded. So the seed is a
  # checksum of the natural key and nothing else, which is `WorldSeed`'s own
  # doctrine about what identifies a place.
  #
  # `Zlib.crc32` AND NOT `String#hash`, for the reason this file's header gives
  # in full: `String#hash` is salted per process, so seeding from it would make
  # the same room come out differently after a restart. A checksum is a stable
  # integer function of the bytes, which is the one property required here.
  #
  # A CHECKSUM IS FAR LARGER THAN ANY COUNT, so it would collide freely with
  # `Location::Danger`'s `SEQUENCE_BASE + location.id` band on the `sequence`
  # axis. A kind of its own is what makes that impossible -- see the header on
  # why an axis beats a convention.

  # keys where in a room somebody stands on exactly that number. Two rolls of
  # different kinds are different dice whatever either one counts, so a kind is
  # what keeps where somebody is standing and what they decide to do from being
  # the same number twice.
  VOLITION = 7
  # WHO A GENERATED PERSON IS BEFORE THE MODEL WRITES THEM
  # (`Character::Generator`): race, age, sex and the other predetermined

  # a count on the `sequence` axis that every kind-0 roll also counts on, so a
  # kind of its own keeps the next person's details from being some check's
  # die. A realized room's cast is not this kind: it draws from the room's own
  # `Location::Danger.generator_for`, after the `monstrous?` throws.

  # 9 TO 12 ARE THE RUST ENGINE'S: a fall through a doorway, whether a thing

  # app.
  #
  # WHAT STANDS IN A ROOM AND WHAT LIES ABOUT IN IT (`Item::Kit`). Its identity
  # is WHICH PLACE, by the room's NAME, for `POPULATION`'s reason verbatim: a
  # room's furniture is a fact about somewhere, a re-seeded world is the same
  # somewhere, and the realization bench re-loads a world per repetition. A kind
  # of its own is what keeps a room's furniture from being its population's die.
