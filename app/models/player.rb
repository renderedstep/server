# SOMEBODY INVITED TO PLAY OVER THE API, and the only thing the API knows
# about them.
#
# There is no signup and no password. The maintainer runs
# `rake players:invite[name]`, which prints a token exactly once; this row keeps
# only its SHA-256 digest, so a copy of the database cannot be replayed as a
# login. A token is 32 random bytes, which is why a fast digest is enough here
# where a password would need a slow one: there is nothing to guess.
#
# A player reaches only their own playthroughs (`playthroughs.player_id`);
# worlds stay shared, and a room a player's turn realizes joins the world like
# any other. What a player may spend is `monthly_limit_usd`, enforced by
# `Player::Allowance` before a turn is accepted and before a call through the
# model relay (`Relay`) is forwarded -- the same token opens both. Revoking
# keeps the row and its receipts -- spend already metered must stay on the
# books -- and stops the token authenticating; `rake players:reissue[name]`
# replaces a lost or revoked token on the same row.
