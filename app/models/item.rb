# A thing in the world, and WHERE IT IS is the whole of what this class is for.
#
# TWO LAYERS, ONE TABLE, and `playthrough_id` is which layer a row is in. The
# captain's ruling of 2026-09-04: *"each play through should have its own copy
# of items. If a location is generated with items in it, that should become the
# initial snapshot that any playthrough uses but what happens to the items after
# that should be managed by the playthrough."*
#
#   THE WORLD LAYER -- a TEMPLATE, `playthrough_id` nil. What a room or a person
#   was seeded or generated with. Written by `WorldSeed::Loader` and
#   `Item::Registry`, exported by `WorldSeed::Exporter`, counted by the caps
#   (`Item::Registry::MAX_PER_ROOM` / `MAX_PER_STORY`, `Story::Doctor`), and
#   NEVER touched by anybody playing. A template is lying in a room or in one of
#   the world's people's hands, and those are its only two places: nobody is
#   playing the world, so the world has no party for anything to be carried by.
#
#   THE PLAYTHROUGH LAYER -- an INSTANCE, `playthrough_id` set. That game's own
#   copy of a template, made at first contact by `Item::Snapshot`. Its place is
#   `location_id` (lying in a room, in that game), `character_id` (in that
#   person's hands, in that game) or NEITHER, which is the party's own hands.
#   That last reading requires `disposition: intact`: a consumed or burned
#   copy has neither holder nor floor and remains only to prevent respawning.
#   THIS IS THE ONLY LAYER PLAY EVER READS OR WRITES: `Playthrough::Classifier`'s
#   closed sets, `Playthrough::Turn#carry!` / `#put_down!` / `#read_item`,
#   the engine's `moment`, `Playthrough::Refusal`'s lists and the
#   `rake game:mechanics` read-out see instances and nothing else.
#
# `template_id` IS THE LINK, and it is what makes the split answerable. It says
# which world row a copy is a copy OF -- so `rake game:doctor` can tell this
# playthrough's ward stamp from a fresh thing of the same name, `Item::Snapshot`
# copies a template exactly once per playthrough however many turns walk back
# through the room, and a template written into a room nobody has visited yet
# still reaches every game that walks in later. It is nullable and NOT validated
# on an instance, deliberately: a template can be deleted out from under its
# copies, and that is a state `rake game:doctor` reports
# (`instance_without_a_template`) rather than one a copy is refused for having.
#
# WHAT THE SHAPE COSTS, stated rather than discovered. Under the old rule an
# item was in exactly one of three places, never two and never NONE, and "none"
# was a real defect -- a row no closed set could ever offer. For an INSTANCE
# "none" is now a place while intact: the party's hands. So the "never none" leg survives on
# templates only, and a bug that nulled an instance's `location_id` would make
# it look carried rather than look broken. Two shapes were considered and
# rejected for costing more than that:
#
#   a fourth column   keep `playthrough_id` meaning the party's hands and add a
#                     separate scope column. The three-place rule survives
#                     verbatim -- and every row that is carried then names its
#                     playthrough twice, in two columns that can disagree, and
#                     every query has to know which one it wants.
#   a second table    `item_instances`. Same problem one table over: the scope
#                     column is the table, so the party still needs a place of
#                     its own, and `Item.in_story`, the caps, the doctor, the
#                     exporter and the audit all fork into two queries that can
#                     drift. One table keeps one `in_story`.
#
# THE PARTY IS NOT THE PROTAGONIST'S HANDS, which is the other shape that would
# have kept "never none": an instance held by `story.protagonist` reads as the
# party, since the party IS the protagonist plus companions. It was rejected
# because `Playthrough#character` is optional and a world can be seeded with no
# protagonist at all, so it would leave some parties with nowhere to put
# anything -- and because it re-couples the inventory to the character row that
# PR 111 spent a migration decoupling it from.
#
# HOW ITEMS COME TO EXIST is `Item::Registry`, and it is still the only thing in
# the app that creates a TEMPLATE: a room's furniture is written as structured
# records the moment the room is realized, out of the same call that describes
# it, exactly the way its exits are. Not by reading narration and not through a
# tool the narrator may or may not call. `Item::Snapshot` is the only thing that
# creates an INSTANCE, and it creates nothing that is not a copy of a template.
#
# AND WHAT IS WRITTEN ON IT, for the things that have writing on them. A note, a
# letter, a sign, a label: `readable` says the thing has words on it and
# `inscription` holds them, so what a note says is a record the engine owns
# rather than a sentence the narrator improvised and nothing kept. It is
# orthogonal to WHERE the thing is and to WHICH LAYER it is in -- a template in a
# room, an instance in an NPC's hands and one a party is carrying all keep their
# text, because writing belongs to the note and not to the shelf. The words
# reach the prose through `Playthrough::Turn#read_fact`, verbatim and stated;
# `Item::Inscriber` writes them once for a readable thing that arrived without
# any, onto the instance AND back onto its template, so the second player's copy
# of the note is born with the same words instead of paying for different ones.
#
# AND WHERE IN THE ROOM IT IS LYING, which is `x` and `y` -- the captain's
# design words of 2026-09-06, *"locations having an interior where items,
# characters and exits are placed"*, and the fourth slice of that programme.
# `Location::Spot` owns what a position IS and `Location::Placement` is the one
# thing that writes one; what is here is only what the two layers make of it.
#
#   A POSITION GOES WITH A FLOOR, and only with one. Both layers, one rule: a
#   row carries a position when it is LYING IN A ROOM and never otherwise,
#   because a position is read in the plane of the room the row is in and a
#   thing in a pair of hands is in no room. So a template held by one of the
#   world's people has none, an instance in the party's hands has none, and
#   `#a_position_needs_a_floor` refuses the alternative. THE TAKE AND THE DROP
#   ARE THE PATH THAT MATTERS: `Playthrough::Turn#carry!` clears the position
#   because the thing is in a hand now, and `#put_down!` rolls a new one
#   because it is on a floor again. It does not come back to where it was, and
#   that is not something this file could arrange -- it is not on record, and a
#   thing set down is set down where the person setting it down was.
#
#   THE TEMPLATE'S POSITION IS THE INITIAL SNAPSHOT, which is the captain's
#   ruling of 2026-09-04 read one column further. `x` and `y` are deliberately
#   NOT in `NOT_COPIED`: a copy of a chair standing by the window is a chair
#   standing by the window, so `Item::Snapshot` brings the position along with
#   everything else, and from then on the playthrough's own copy moves on its
#   own and the world's row never does. The copy cannot land somewhere illegal
#   by doing this -- a template with a position is lying in a room (the rule
#   above), and a copy of a template lying in a room lies in that same room.
#
#   AND A RE-SEED DOES NOT PUSH IT BACK DOWN. `Item::TemplateRefresh` follows
#   what the WORLD says a thing IS -- its words, its description, its bulk -- and
#   a position is where one copy of it happens to be lying in one game, which is
#   the player's business. See that class's header.
#
# AND HOW HARD IT IS TO SHIFT, which is `bulk` -- the captain's request of
# 2026-09-05, *"I want players to be able to pick up items and throw them based
# on a strength check"*, and the half of that arithmetic that lives on the
# thing. It is orthogonal to WHERE the thing is and to WHICH LAYER it is in for
# exactly `readable`'s reason: how heavy a slate is is a fact about the slate.
# `BULK` is the closed table, `THROWN_DAMAGE` the second table on the same key,
# and `Playthrough::Turn#throw_item!` the one writer that reads them.
#
# AND WHETHER IT STANDS IN THE ROOM OR LIES IN IT, which is `tier` -- the
# owner's dense-rooms decision of 2026-09-27 (D1): *fixtures, parts and
# contents as item rows copied per playthrough.* A desk, a hearth or an old
# tree is a `FIXTURE`: fixed in place, `immovable`, and never anybody's to
# carry; everything else is `PORTABLE`, which is every row written before the
# column. A fixture says what it `holds` -- `HOLDS` -- and a portable thing
# lying on or in one names it as `within`, with `how` saying which. That is a
# refinement of the room it lies in rather than a fourth place: a thing on the
# desk still carries the room as its `location_id`, carries no position of its
# own (the desk's is its place), and leaves the desk the moment it leaves the
# floor. `Item::Kit` furnishes a room with them as it is written; a seed file
# may place them by hand. `kit_key` says which kit entry wrote a row, and it is
# the whole of what the caps read to count only the room writer's own things.

  # A copy of a thing IS that thing: a daybook with no page count, or a note with
  # nothing written on it, is a different object from the one the world
  # describes. So `Item::Snapshot` copies attributes rather than naming fields,
  # and this is the whole of the exception list -- which means the next column
  # added to `items` comes along without anybody remembering to add it. Naming
  # the fields is what left `readable` and `inscription` behind when they landed,
  # so every player's copy of a seeded note opened blank while the world's own
  # row held the words.
  #
  # WHERE it is and WHOSE it is are what must not come along, because they are
  # precisely what the copy exists to differ in; `id` and the timestamps belong
  # to the row rather than to the thing.
  #
  # `x` AND `y` ARE DELIBERATELY NOT ON THIS LIST, which reads like an exception
  # to the sentence above and is not. WHICH ROOM a copy is in is what it exists
  # to differ in; WHERE IN THAT ROOM is the initial snapshot the captain's
  # ruling of 2026-09-04 is about -- *"If a location is generated with items in
  # it, that should become the initial snapshot that any playthrough uses"* -- so
  # a copy of a chair standing by the window is a chair standing by the window,
  # and every game that walks in finds it there. It cannot land somewhere
  # illegal by coming along: a template carrying a position is lying in a room
  # (`#a_position_needs_a_floor`), and its copy lies in that same room. From
  # then on the copy moves on its own and the template never does.
