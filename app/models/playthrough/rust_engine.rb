# THE RUST ENGINE, AND EVERYTHING RUBY KNOWS ABOUT IT.
#
# The Rust engine (https://github.com/renderedstep/engine) plays the game:
# `Playthrough::Session#play` hands it every whole turn through a native
# extension (`ext/renderedstep`), so every front end -- the browser, the API,
# anything else that plays through the session -- plays on Rust, and what a
# front end shows between turns is read off it too (`.glance`, `.scaffold`).
# Turbo, the labs, the benches, the doctor, repair, seeding and every backfill
# stay Ruby, on the same database. README.md ("The Rust engine") says how to
# build it; a checkout cannot play without it.
#
# THERE IS NO FALLBACK. A turn the engine cannot play fails, in the engine's
# own words, and is never played again on Ruby behind the player's back:
# `EngineError` carries the words, `Playthrough::Session.ending_for` shows them
# as the turn's failure notice, and `.failed!` logs and counts it. That covers
# an extension that is not built or does not load, a database transaction left
# open around the call (SQLite has one writer, and the engine writes on its own
# connection), and every error the engine answers with: a schema it is not
# written against, a rule it does not play yet, a database failure, a panic it
# caught.
#
# A MODEL FAILURE IS HOW A TURN ENDED, not an engine error. It is raised as the
# Ruby app's own exception for it (`.exception_for`), so the player is told what
# they have always been told: the crisis notice, the setup notice, the failure
# copy.
#
# THE RUBY TURN LOOP IS KEPT UNTIL ITS TESTS HAVE COUNTERPARTS, and nothing
# plays it but them. `Playthrough::Turn` stays in the code while its own tests
# still run (test/ruby_loop_coverage.yml names, for each, the check that holds
# the Rust engine to the same behaviour), and `.using(:ruby)` plays it for one
# block -- for asking by hand where the two loops part. No setting turns it on
# for a player, and the test suite plays Rust.
#
# THE CREDENTIALS ARE THE ONES RUBY USES. `.models` reads `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
# (the Direct route), `OPENROUTER_MODEL`, and the System One keys exactly as
# `BaseAgent` and `SystemOneAgent` do, and hands them over as one document.
# Nothing here logs that document, and the engine keeps a key as a value that
# cannot be printed. The local rotation (`TA_LOCAL_MODELS`) is Ruby's alone, so
# it never reaches a turn.
