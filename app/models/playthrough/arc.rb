# WHERE THE ARC IS READ, ONE TURN AT A TIME -- and it is the app reading its own
# records, never a model being asked what happened.
#
# THE STANDING CONSTRAINT, applied to plot. The direction report weighed three
# ways of deciding a beat had been reached and only one survives: asking the
# narrator by tool call is a call a model may silently not make; a second model
# pass costs 2.4-7.3 s to answer *"no beat reached"* on almost every turn; and
# the app reading four record predicates costs about four milliseconds and no
# tokens at all. So a beat is reached because the records say so.
#
# --- the four predicates, and why each is asked of a PLAYTHROUGH ------------
#
#   reach_location  the party is standing in the room. Read off
#                   `playthrough.current_location_id`, which is an attribute
#                   already in hand -- no query at all.
#   speak_to        this turn's `Scene` carries an `Interaction` with them.
#                   `Playthrough::Turn#talk_to` writes both in one statement, so
#                   the scene the turn just produced is the honest per-game
#                   record of who was spoken to.
#   hold_item       this game's own copy of the thing is in the party's hands.
#                   `Playthrough#carried` is the ONE reader of that closed set
#                   and this comes through it, so the arc and the classifier
#                   cannot come to disagree about what the player is holding.
#   time_passed     this game's clock has passed the story's start by the step's
#                   own minutes. `Playthrough#story_now` and not `Story#clock`:
#                   the story's clock is the high-water mark across every
#                   playthrough, and a beat is one player's.
#
# EVERY ONE OF THEM IS A QUESTION ABOUT ONE GAME, which is why they live here
# and not on `Quest::Step`. What the world says a step IS belongs to the world;
# whether somebody has reached it belongs to the game.
#
# --- where it runs, and the three rules it inherits by running there --------
#
# `Playthrough::Turn#play` after the tolls are claimed and the world has
# answered, beside `Playthrough::Riposte` and `Playthrough::Hazards`; and
# `Playthrough::Mechanics#answered_by_the_world`, in the same place, so the
# browser and the offline sweep cannot come to disagree about whether an arc
# moved. All three of that step's rules are right for this:
#
#   A REFUSED LINE EVALUATES NOTHING -- a refused line writes nothing, so it
#   cannot reach a beat. The captain's ruling of 2026-09-04.
#   AN ENGINE-VIEW INSTRUMENT EVALUATES NOTHING -- `stats`, `check`, a read-out
#   is not a turn.
#   IT RUNS ON EVERY LINE THE ENGINE PLAYED -- a look, a read, a move. A player
#   who walks into the right room and then stands there typing `look` has still
#   reached the beat, because standing there is what the step asked for.
#
# AFTER THE HAZARDS AND NOT BEFORE THEM, which is the one ordering decision here
# and it is load-bearing: a room whose hazard takes the last hit point ends the
# game on this turn, and an arc that concluded before the world had finished
# acting would hand a dead player an ending.
#
# --- WHICH OF SEVERAL ENDINGS, AND THE ENGINE DECIDES IT -------------------
#
# *"multiple endings to a quest must be possible"*, 2026-09-06. The endings are
# `Quest::Outcome` rows and WHICH ONE a game reaches is decided here, off this
# game's own records: **the first outcome whose condition holds wins, and the
# default is what falling through means.** `Quest::Outcome::CONDITIONS` is the
# closed table of rules, in `Quest::TRIGGERS`' shape; `#satisfies?` is the
# predicate, and it is public for `#reached?`'s reason -- a read-out and a sweep
# have to be able to state a rule's state without writing one.
#
# NOTHING ASKS A MODEL WHICH ENDING HAPPENED. Every rule is arithmetic over
# rows this game already wrote -- how long it took (`slower_than`), in what
# order it got there (`out_of_order`) and whether somebody was still alive when
# it did (`while_alive`) -- which is what lets an offline walk reach a
# NON-default ending and assert it.
#
# --- what it may write, and what it must never -----------------------------
#
# IT WRITES `playthrough_beats`, `playthrough_endings`, `playthroughs.ended_at`,
# ONE `Scene`, and up to TWO `WorldEvent`s. It writes nothing in `quests`,
# `quest_steps` or `quest_outcomes` -- the arc is the world's, exactly as a stat
# block is, and `EngineSweep::Invariants#quest_unmoved` asserts that over every
# walk.
#
# AND IT NEVER CREATES A `Location`. Growing the world toward an unbound target
# is `Quest::Deadline`'s, which runs at realization -- the moment the world
# grows -- and not on a turn.
#
# --- the ending, and why the engine writes this one paragraph ---------------
#
# THE GAME BEING OVER IS NEVER A MODEL'S DECISION. Reaching the last step of the
# main arc writes the reached outcome, `playthroughs.ended_at` and an
# engine-authored closing `Scene` -- `Scene::ENGINE_AUTHORED` gains `"conclude"`
# so `Story::Audit` and `Eval::Richness` skip it and `Story::Scoreboard` counts
# it excluded, because a smaller denominator must never read as a better rate.
#
# AND THE STORED SENTENCE IS THE FALLBACK, NOT THE ANSWER. The captain's Call 5
# of 2026-09-06 chose *the narrator writes a real ending, told the conclusion*,
# and his Q4 on the same board chose an engine-authored one. Those are one
# paragraph asked about on two boards, and the project's own rule splits them
# without overruling either: **the engine owns the fact, the narrator writes the
# prose, the stored sentence is the fallback** the way `Refusal#text` is one.
#
# THE PROSE HALF LANDED IN `ta-quest-ending` AND NONE OF IT IS IN THIS FILE.
# `#conclusion` is the whole of the seam: this class writes the outcome, the
# `ended_at` and the closing `Scene` with the sentence already on it, and says
# what it wrote. `Scene::Ending` -- called from `Playthrough::Turn#play`, after
# this and outside the transaction -- renders that row in place. NOTHING HERE
# MAKES A MODEL CALL, which is not a tidiness argument: `Playthrough::Mechanics`
# runs this same method for the offline sweep, so a call in here would be a call
# in a walk that is supposed to make none. What a sweep therefore walks to is
# the fallback, which is the guarantee worth being able to prove.
#
# --- and failure, which is not the opposite of completable ------------------
#
# A playthrough that ENDS with its arc unfinished writes a `WorldEvent` --
# *"a failed quest gets stored as an event that can have future ramifications"*,
# 2026-09-06. The event names the playthrough it happened in, because a failure
# is one game's and the stream is the story's; see `WorldEvent`. `Quest#status`
# is untouched: the world still permitted the ending, this player did not reach
# it, and `Story::Doctor`'s `quest_target_unreachable` stays fatal about the
# first while saying nothing about the second.
#
# AND SO DOES A PLAYTHROUGH THAT FINISHED, which is new and is the answer to a
# question the captain asked the arc's own worker directly. `Playthrough::Ending`
# stays the record of WHICH ending happened; the `WorldEvent` is the hook
# something later reads -- and a stream that carried only failures would make
# every future reader of *"what has happened in this world"* ask two questions
# where the point of one stream is that it asks one.
#
# A FAILURE REACHES NO OUTCOME, and that is why it schedules no ramification:
# an outcome is an ending the arc got to, and a game that stopped short got to
# none. Making failure a selectable outcome is a real option the shape leaves
# open -- a `"failed"` row in `Quest::Outcome::CONDITIONS` and nothing else
# would move -- and it is deliberately not taken here, because an ending is the
# paragraph a game closes on and a dead player already has one.
class Playthrough::Arc
  # WHAT ONE TURN ENDED THE GAME WITH: the ending row, the outcome it names and
  # the `Scene` its sentence is already on. A Data and not three readers,
