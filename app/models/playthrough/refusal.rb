# WHAT THE ENGINE SAYS WHEN IT WILL NOT PLAY A LINE, and the one author of it.
#
# THE CAPTAIN'S RULING, 2026-09-04, in his words:
#
#   *"If someone tries to do two things or more at a time, we should refuse and
#   prompt the player to pick only 1 thing. Or if we can't determine what they
#   are trying to do, then we should refuse and ask for clarification. This can
#   all be in the mechanics and doesn't need to go through narration."*
#
# So a refused line is a turn that DID NOTHING: no row moves, no `Scene` is
# written, the story's clock does not advance, the playthrough does not move,
# and no narrator is asked for a sentence about it. What the player gets instead
# is this -- the app's own words, built out of records it is already holding,
# for no model call beyond the classifier that had already run.
#
# THE SHAPES, TOLD APART BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT FACTS -- three about the
# LINE, one about a THING the line named, and three about the game it was typed
# into:
#
#   :named_more_than_one  it named two things the records really have, and a
#                         turn is one act. Nothing named is missing; the limit
#                         is the loop's. Counted by `Playthrough::Overreach`.
#   :unresolved           it reached for a way out, a person or a thing the
#                         closed sets do not have. Counted by
#                         `Playthrough::Drift`. An `examine` is never this: a
#                         look is not reaching for a record it could have
#                         missed, which is why `Playthrough::Drift::ACTIONS`
#                         does not carry it and `Playthrough::Overreach::ACTIONS`
#                         does.
#   :immovable            IT NAMED A THING THAT DOES NOT MOVE. The one refusal
#                         shape that is a fact about a record rather than about
#                         the reading: a `take` or `throw` of something whose
#                         `Item::BULK` carries no penalty. No die is thrown,
#                         nothing happens and no story time is spent, which is
#                         what makes it a refusal instead of the FUMBLE a failed
#                         lift is -- a fumble is a turn the engine PLAYED and
#                         this is a turn it would not. Counted by nothing: it is
#                         neither drift (the reach resolved, twice) nor
#                         overreach (one act was asked for). See
#                         `data/ta-combat-scout` §13.3.
#   :unreadable           the classifier's own answer was unusable -- an intent
#                         outside `Playthrough::IntentSchema::INTENTS` that
#                         still named a record. Nothing counts it, because it is
#                         a defect on our side rather than a reach on the
#                         player's; it goes to the log.
#   :unplayable           THE GAME CANNOT PERFORM THE ACT AT ALL, whatever the
#                         line said. It is `:dead`'s neighbour rather than
#                         `:unresolved`'s -- a fact about the GAME and not about
#                         the reading -- and the reading was perfect: the
#                         classifier or the grammar resolved a real record out of
#                         a real closed set, and then there was nobody to put it
#                         in the hands of. A story with nobody marked
#                         `is_protagonist` (`Story::Doctor`'s `:no_protagonist`)
#                         gives a playthrough a nil `character`, so a `take` or a
#                         `throw` has no hands; a playthrough standing nowhere has
#                         no floor to `drop` onto. Both used to NARRATE the
#                         attempt, which is how the captain's playthrough 24 of
#                         2026-09-05 read him a perfect paragraph about pocketing
#                         a signet ring that never left the floor -- the
#                         narration lied and the records were honest. Counted by
#                         nothing: the reach resolved, one act was asked for, and
#                         it is a defect in the WORLD rather than in the line.
#                         The player is told what is wrong;
#                         `PlaythroughsController` refuses to start such a game
#                         in the first place.
#   :dead                 THE PLAYER IS DEAD AND THE GAME IS OVER -- the
#                         captain's ruling of 2026-09-04. It is not a reading of
#                         a line at all: it is refused BEFORE the classifier
#                         runs, so it costs no model call and no line is ever
#                         read again in this playthrough. It is the one shape
#                         here that is a fact about the GAME rather than about
#                         the line, which is why it is built from
#                         `Playthrough::DeathNotice` and not from an `Intent`,
#                         and why `.for` never returns one. Counted by nothing:
#                         a dead player reaching for nothing is not drift.
#   :concluded            THE STORY IS OVER AND THE GAME WITH IT -- the arc
#                         reached its last step, `Playthrough::Arc#conclude!`
#                         wrote the ending, and nothing killed anybody. The same
#                         shape as `:dead` in every respect but its words, which
#                         are `Playthrough::StoryOverNotice`'s. `.over` is what
#                         chooses between the two, off records, through
#                         `Playthrough::EndNotice`; `.for` never returns one
#                         either.
#   :stopped              THE GAME IS OVER AND THE RECORDS DO NOT SAY WHY -- no
#                         ending reached and nobody at zero. The same shape
#                         again, in `Playthrough::StoppedNotice`'s words, which
#                         claim neither a death nor an ending; `.over` picks it
#                         through `Playthrough::EndNotice` like the other two.
#
# THE COUNTERS ARE UNTOUCHED BY THE RULING, and that is deliberate: it changes
# what a turn DOES, not what is measured. `Playthrough::Classifier#classify`
# writes the `Playthrough::Overreach` or `Playthrough::Drift` row before the
# loop ever asks whether the line is refused, from exactly the place it always
# did, and both are free.
#
# WHAT IS *NOT* REFUSED, because the line matters as much as the rule. A
# coherent non-mechanic line -- `other`, or an `examine` that landed on nothing
# -- is not undeterminable. "look at the sky", "wait", a remark to nobody: the
# classifier placed them, they reach for no record they could have missed, and
# they stay narrated. Refusing them would refuse everything that is not one of
# the acts that move a row, which is a different game. An `examine` that named
# TWO things IS refused, like any other line asking twice: a readable thing
# named alongside another thing is one line asking for two acts.
#
# WHY A REFUSAL IS NOT A `Scene`. It is the app talking rather than the world,
# which is the same argument `Playthrough::SafetyNotice` and
# `Playthrough::TurnFailureNotice` are made of, and it is also what the
# instruments require: `Scene#description` is read as NARRATION by
# `Story::Audit`, `Eval::Richness` and both frozen corpora, and a row of engine
# copy in that column would be audited as prose the narrator wrote. A refusal
# also has no moment in it -- `Scene`'s `after_create` stamps
# `Location#last_protagonist_visit` and `Story#clock` is
# `MAX(scenes.story_timestamp)` -- so writing one would move story time on a
# turn whose whole point is that nothing happened. The durable record of a
# refused line is the counter row, which is the table built to hold exactly it.
#
# `#reason` AND `#text` ARE THE SAME COPY IN TWO ORDERS, because the two
# consumers differ in one respect and only one. `Playthrough::Mechanics` prints
# the whole engine read-out under every refusal, so it reads `#reason` and the
# lists are printed once. The browser has no read-out, so it reads `#text` --
# the same fact with what IS here folded into the middle of it, which is the
# answer a player standing in the wrong room needs. The pieces are held apart
# (`fact`, `offer`, `UNCHANGED`) so that both orders read as English rather than
# as one string with another bolted onto the end.
