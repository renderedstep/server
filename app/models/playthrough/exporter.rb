# ONE PLAYTHROUGH AS A JSON FILE, keyed by names rather than database ids.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. A GitHub issue about a played-in world needs the turns, the
# commands, the rooms as they stood, and the model exchanges that wrote them --
# not a pointer into somebody's development.sqlite3. `WorldSeed::Exporter` is
# the world's own dump and deliberately leaves progress behind; this is the
# other half: one player's way through a story, with enough of the world beside
# it that the file can be read alone.
#
# READ ONLY. Nothing here asks a model, writes a row, or advances a clock -- the
# same rule `Playthrough::Debug` is under, for the same reason: looking at a
# game must not move it. The file is a photograph.
#
# NAMES, NOT IDS. Every cross-reference is a written name (`Location#name`,
# `Character#fullname`, `Item#name`) or a turn key built from story time, place
# and typed line. Journal receipts that stored `{ "record" => "...", "id" => N }`
# are re-resolved to names on the way out, so a future reader never has to
# open the database that produced the file.
#
# WHAT IT CARRIES:
#
#   * the story's title, genre, preface and summary -- enough to know which
#     world this was without re-exporting the seed
#   * every location of the story (stubs included), with parent, footprint /
#     box, prose and the exits between them by name
#   * every character, with world whereabouts and this game's `NpcState`
#   * world-layer items and this playthrough's copies, each saying where they
#     lie or who holds them
#   * the turn log (`Playthrough#scene_chain`), with branch and evidence from
#     `Playthrough::Debug` so the file says what the debug page would
#   * every submitted command and its journal / refusal
#   * drifts, overreaches, feedback, tolls, beats
#   * every chat this playthrough still holds, prompts and answers included --
#     the receipts that explain why a room came out the way it did
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not a seed file and it will not load back into a
# database. For a restoreable miniature primary DB of this playthrough's story,
# see `Playthrough::SqlitePackage` / `rake game:dump_playthrough`.
