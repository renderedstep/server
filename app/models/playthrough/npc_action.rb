# The immediate effects a character may choose during a conversation. A choice
# is an opaque token in a table built from this game's records, not an action
# extracted from dialogue. The table is rebuilt when the answer arrives, so a
# stale choice, somebody else's item or a dead/absent speaker cannot act.
#
# Speech and private resolutions remain prose. Only this class writes the
# supported effects, before the narrator sees them; its receipt says exactly
# which choice was applied or rejected and is kept on the Interaction.
