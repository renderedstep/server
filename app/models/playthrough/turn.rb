# One turn of the game: the player types something, the world answers, and the
# playthrough ends up wherever that left them.
#
# This is the loop, and it lives in `app/models` rather than in a controller or
# a rake task on purpose -- there is no `rake game:play` and there is not meant
# to be. No front end reaches this class directly: `Playthrough::Session` is the
# one way in, and a front end's whole share of the loop is handing the session
# a string and a block to write chunks into.
#
# `move`, `talk`, `take` and `drop` are the four outcomes that do something
# particular, and each of them writes a record before any prose exists. Reading
# is the fifth: an `examine` that resolved to a thing the records say has WRITING
# on it is answered out of `Item#inscription`, which the narrator is handed
# verbatim, so what a note says cannot change between two readings of it. It
# writes a record too, on the one turn where there is not one yet -- see
# `#read_item`.
#
# AND `attack` IS THE SIXTH, and the only one of them that produces no prose at
# all: it writes a `Playthrough::Blow`, the world's live foes answer it in the
# same turn (`Playthrough::Riposte`, step 7 below), and ONE `Scene` closes the
# fight when it ends (`Playthrough::Fight`). SINCE COMBAT SLICE 8 IT REACHES
# THIS LOOP BOTH WAYS: `Playthrough::Grammar` behind a slash, for no model call
# at all, and `Playthrough::Classifier` off a free line -- it is the seventh
# word in `Playthrough::IntentSchema::INTENTS` now, resolved against the same
# closed set a `talk` is. The dispatch is one branch on a resolved person and
# the action says which of the two it was; see `#play`.
#
# AND `throw` IS THE SEVENTH, the only act in the game that names TWO records:
# `throw <thing> at <somebody or a way out>`. One d20 under strength less what
# the thing weighs (`Item::BULK`, through the one check kernel), and no second
# roll to see whether it hit -- a throw that leaves your hands goes where you
# aimed it, exactly as a blow that lands lands. It writes through the two
# statements this class already owns, `#put_down!` and `#harm!`, in one
# transaction, and a hit at a person is a BLOW like any other, so the riposte
# and the fight-end rule see it without knowing what threw it. Unlike `attack`
# it is NOT one of `Playthrough::IntentSchema::INTENTS` and is not going to be
# -- two records will not fit in one `target` -- so it reaches this loop only
# through `Playthrough::Grammar`. See `#throw_item!`.
#
# Everything else -- a look at something with nothing written on it, and
# anything unclassifiable -- falls through to the narrator
# (`Playthrough::Turn#narrate`), which answers the raw command in prose. They
# are told apart so the classification is honest and so the branches that need
# to exist have somewhere to land.
#
# AND A GAME THAT IS OVER, WHICH IS NOT A TURN EITHER: once the player is dead
# `#play` refuses every line in front of everything else it does -- before the
# world catches up, before the snapshot, before the classifier -- so a line
# typed into a finished game costs no model call and writes nothing at all. The
# captain's ruling of 2026-09-04: *"zero hit points means death. Playthrough is
# over and you can't do anything else. You have to start a new playthrough."*
# See `Playthrough::DeathNotice` for the words and `#harm!` for the one
# statement that ends a game.
#
# AND A LAST OUTCOME THAT IS NOT A TURN AT ALL, SINCE 2026-09-04: a line the
# engine will not play. Two acts on one line, a reach that resolved to nothing,
# or a classifier answer the app cannot read are REFUSED whole -- no write, no
# narrator, no `Scene`, no story time -- and `#play` answers with a
# `Playthrough::Refusal` instead of a turn. That is the captain's ruling, and it
# replaced narrating the attempt: a `move` to a door that is not there, a `talk`
# to nobody, a `take` of what is not lying here and a `drop` of what is not
# carried all used to reach the narrator (`Playthrough::Turn#narrate`) with a
# fact saying so. A look at something with nothing written on it is NOT one of
# them -- an `examine` is not reaching for a record it can miss, so it narrates
# exactly as it always did. Read `Playthrough::Refusal`'s header before changing
# which lines land there.
#
# AND THE LINE IS NOT ALWAYS READ BY A MODEL, since the captain's ruling of
# 2026-09-04, evening: *"support a slash prefix autocomplete in the text box,
# and resolve those and verb-prefixed lines offline then fallback to the
# model."* A line beginning with `/` goes to `Playthrough::Grammar` first and
# reaches `Playthrough::Classifier` only when the grammar could not resolve the
# noun; a line WITHOUT one is not claimed at all, whatever it begins with, which
# is his ruling of 2026-09-05 -- *"I think we should only auto accept the slash
# commands"* -- after he objected that *"a line beginning with `move`"* should
# not always be a move. `#read_line` is the whole of it, `scenes.resolved_by` is
# which reader answered, and everything below the read is one path either way --
# the grammar builds the same `Intent` the classifier does, on purpose.

    # recoverable only by scraping the classifier's stored prompt, which the
    # conversation pruner can still be asked to throw away (Chat::KEEP_TURNS),
    # so the player's own words disappeared from older turns.

    # `resolved_action` and `acted_on` are the same argument taken one step

    # has carried it or every later turn would be told again. Here rather than

    # moment later. An `every_turn` toll is written in step 7, AFTER this, so it
    # is told by the NEXT turn's paragraph and claimed by the next turn's
    # scene -- which is exactly the shape `Playthrough::Riposte`'s blows already

    # states the UNTOLD acts as facts, so one of them has to stop being untold
    # once a paragraph has said it or every later turn would be told again.
    #
    # A VOLITION IS ALWAYS THE PREVIOUS TURN'S, which is the one difference

  # WHICH READER ANSWERS THE LINE, AND THE GRAMMAR GETS FIRST REFUSAL.
  #
  # THE CAPTAIN'S RULING OF 2026-09-04, EVENING, in his words: *"support a slash
  # prefix autocomplete in the text box, and resolve those and verb-prefixed
  # lines offline then fallback to the model."*
  #
  # And then, 2026-09-05, after he objected that a line beginning with `move`
  # might be *"move the lamp off the desk"*: ***"I think we should only auto
  # accept the slash commands."*** He was right and it was worse than the
  # example -- `Playthrough::Grammar::MEANS_SOMETHING_ELSE` has the four
  # measured wrong answers a leading verb alone produced.
  #
  # So A LINE THAT BEGINS WITH `/` is read by `Playthrough::Grammar` before
  # anything is spent on it, and a line without one is not claimed at all
  # whatever its first word. If the grammar RESOLVED A RECORD out of the same
  # closed set the classifier would have been offered, that is the answer and
  # there is no model call at all: the turn saves ~0.6s of the player's time and
  # the app a call, and `Eval::Classifier` measured the verb half at
  # ~0.98 while the TARGET half is where the misses are -- and a target is a
  # match against ONE closed list, which is not a thing a model is needed for.
  #
  # EVERYTHING ELSE GOES TO THE CLASSIFIER, EXACTLY AS BEFORE -- which since the
  # slash became the whole claim is every line a player types without one,
  # measured at 339 of 339 on `Eval::Classifier`'s corpus. And a SLASHED line the
  # grammar could not RESOLVE falls through too -- a name it could not place, a
  # name that matched two records, a verb it does not have. That is deliberate
  # and it is the whole reason the model is still here: every one of those
  # refusals is "I could not read the noun", which is `Playthrough::Classifier`'s
  # job, and taking the grammar's word for it would refuse lines the model plays
  # today. The grammar answers when it is sure and gets out of the way when it
  # is not.
  #
  # ONE LINE ONE ACT SURVIVES THIS, and it survives without a second copy of the
  # rule. The grammar has no `also_named` -- nothing in a fixed verb table
  # produces one -- so a line naming two things out of one closed set would
  # resolve the first and PLAY it. `Playthrough::Grammar::JOINING_WORDS` is what
  # stops that: such a line is handed on, the classifier sees both names, and the
  # refusal and the `Playthrough::Overreach` row happen exactly where they always
  # did. Measured on `Eval::Classifier`'s corpus; the constant has the figures.
  #
  # WHAT THIS COSTS, STATED. A grammar-resolved turn writes no
  # `Playthrough::Drift` and no `Playthrough::Overreach` row -- both are taken
  # inside `Playthrough::Classifier#classify`, which did not run -- so it is
  # invisible to those counters and to the classifier bench.
  # `scenes.resolved_by` is what makes that legible instead of silent: every
  # instrument can size its denominator on the turns its reader actually read.
  #
  # Returns `[intent, resolved_by]`, and `resolved_by` is one of
  # `Playthrough::Grammar::PATHS` -- never `engine_view`, because the browser has
  # no engine view: `stats`, `harm 5` and `check the ledger` are not claimed and
  # reach the classifier the way they always did.

  # for the same reason the played path applies it: the classifier had a
  # conversation, and `TA_CHAT_KEEP_TURNS` should take effect on every turn
  # rather than on the ones that landed.
  #

  # THE LOAD-OR-GENERATE SEAM. Everything the project is about is these four
  # lines, and the reason there is no branch in them is the design:
  #
  #   * `Location::Generator#realize!` writes a stub out in full and returns an
  #     already-realized location untouched. So walking somewhere new writes it
  #     once and walking back reads what was written -- the same call, and no
  #     code path that can regenerate a place the player has already seen.
  #   * `Scene::Generator` then narrates arriving, and reads differently the
  #     second time: it reads this game's own scene chain, so the room the
  #     player left an hour ago is narrated as coming back rather than as
  #     finding -- and a room only another game has stood in is not. That is what makes a persisted
  #     world feel persisted instead of merely being persisted.
  #   * `Scene::Generator` raises on a stub, which is why realizing is first
  #     and not optional.
  #
  # Realization must finish before the crossing is charged. Once charged, an
  # arrival has factual fallback prose if its model fails, so it completes in
  # the destination and the same submission can never pay for crossing twice.
  #
  # AND WALKING INTO A BUILDING IS WALKING INTO A ROOM OF IT. The captain's
  # ruling of 2026-09-06 -- *"the prince should be in a Room inside a Location,
  # not in an unrealized location"* -- said about the party: nobody ever stands
  # in a container. #walk_in! is where that happens and its header is why it
  # cannot happen any earlier.

    # is standing here -- have to exist before
    # `Scene::Generator` builds the moment, or the arrival narration would be
    # written about a room the records say is empty for this game. A room that

    # direction. See `Playthrough::Hazards` -- and note that a hazard reaches

  # answer to "does the player have it", written out of the closed set

  # owns the story made out of them.
  #
  # A failed narration leaves the item taken and records a factual sentence in
  # its place. The turn then completes its enemy response, hazards and time;
  # losing a provider's paragraph is never an opportunity to take a free turn.

  # A PLAYTHROUGH WITH NO CHARACTER NEVER REACHES HERE, and that is the fix of

  # (`Playthrough::Turn#narrate`) the bare command, so the model wrote a perfect
  # paragraph about pocketing the thing and the row stayed on the floor -- the
  # owner's playthrough 24, where they picked up a signet ring and a key and the
  # machinery panel showed both still lying there. The comment above that guard
  # said *"nothing in the app creates such a playthrough"*, and the Play button
  # did: their story had no character marked `is_protagonist`, so
  # `story.protagonist` was nil and `PlaythroughsController#create` opened the
  # game on it anyway.
  #
  # So the answer is a REFUSAL in front of the dispatch
  # (`Playthrough::Refusal`'s `:unplayable`), and the controller will not start
  # such a game at all. Since the inventory moved to `items.playthrough_id` the
  # record itself needs no character; what needed one is the FACT handed to the

  # does. What would be wrong is a Scene per ROUND, and the rounds are still
  # `playthrough_blows`.

  # missing thrower and for a thrower with no strength to check, and the first
  # of those is refused in front of the dispatch since 2026-09-05
  # (`#take_item`'s note has the defect it was). A body with no abilities is a

  # the ABSENCE of a room and a holder on a row that is already this
  # playthrough's own. The party's hands are a place inside a game, not a layer:
  # `playthrough_id` says whose game the row belongs to and it is written here
  # only because it is already true -- the classifier resolved this item out of
  # `Playthrough#items_lying_in`, which offers nothing else.
  #
  # WHAT IT MUST NEVER DO IS MOVE A TEMPLATE. The world's own row stays lying in
  # the room it was seeded or generated in, whoever picks up their copy of it;
  # that is the whole of the ruling. Nothing offers a template to a `take`, so
  # this cannot be reached with one, and `Item` refuses the row either way -- a
  # template with a `template_id` is a copy of a copy.
  # AND IT TAKES THE THING OFF THE FLOOR PLAN IN THE SAME STATEMENT. A position
  # is read in the plane of the room a thing is LYING in (`Location::Spot`), so
  # a thing in a hand has no frame and carries no position -- `Item` refuses the
  # alternative, which is what makes forgetting this line impossible rather
  # than invisible. `Item.lifted` is the named set rather than literals -- the
  # position and the fixture the thing lay on -- so nothing can clear half of it.
  #
  # IT DOES NOT REMEMBER WHERE IT WAS, and it is not meant to: `#put_down!`
  # rolls a fresh one, because a thing set down is set down where the person
  # setting it down was standing rather than where it was found.

  # be written nil here, when the column meant "carried"; the drop that
  # exercised it is `lib/engine_sweep/scripts/the-unrecorded-hour-two-players.yml`.
  #
  # `into:` IS WHICH FLOOR, and it defaults to the one the party is standing on
  # because that is where all but one of these land. The exception is a throw
  # through a doorway (`#throw_item!`): the thing goes into the next room and
  # stays there until somebody walks in and picks it up. One keyword, the same
  # statement, and the rule above holds unchanged -- what room a copy is lying
  # in is the player's business either way.
  # AND IT LANDS SOMEWHERE IN THAT ROOM, which the ENGINE rolls: no prose and no
  # typed line says where a dropped thing comes to rest, on the standing
  # constraint's terms. `Location::Placement.in_a_game` is the one writer -- its
  # header has why the seed carries the game and the story's clock -- and it
  # hands back no position at all for a room with no box, which is every room in
  # the three checked-in worlds. So a drop in a flat world writes exactly what
  # it wrote before this slice.
  #

  # is not going to be one (AGENTS.md -> *The standing constraint*). What calls
  # it today is `rake game:mechanics`'s `harm <n>`, which is an engine-view

  #
  # THE FLOOR IS ZERO AND ZERO IS DEATH. `amount` is clamped rather than allowed
  # to go negative, because "how far past dead" is a number this game has no use
  # for -- the ruling is that zero ends it, with no death saves, no unconscious
  # state and no scars.
  #
  # AND IF THE BODY IS THE PLAYER'S, THE GAME ENDS IN THE SAME STATEMENT. That

  # `character: nil` and `Item.in_hand` reads `character_id: nil` with
  # `location_id: nil` (`Playthrough#carried`) -- so the protagonist's set comes
  # back empty and the loop below writes nothing. It is NOT that there is
  # nowhere to drop into: `Playthrough#location_of` answers `current_location`
  # for the party, so `room` is the room they are standing in and this method
  # runs to the end. A player dying therefore leaves the game's inventory
  # exactly as it was. There is no restore-from-save and no revival to hand it
  # back to; loot is what a fight the party WON leaves on the floor.
  #
  # A COMPANION IS NOT THE PARTY HERE, and because the room comes from
  # `#location_of` it is the one case whose answer changed: a companion's own
  # per-game possessions -- rows that DO name them as holder -- fall in the room
  # THIS GAME says they are in, which is their `Playthrough::NpcState` row and
  # the party's own room when they have none. `characters.location_id` is null
  # for the protagonist and for anyone `is_companion` by design (`Character`'s

  # dead companion's things on their record with nowhere to fall.

  # THROWING SOMETHING, AND THE ENGINE DECIDES WHETHER IT GOES.
  #
  # THE CAPTAIN'S REQUEST OF 2026-09-05: *"I want players to be able to pick up
  # items and throw them based on a strength check."* `data/ta-combat-scout` §13
  # is the design and this is it: ONE CHECK -- d20 under strength, less what the
  # thing weighs -- and NO SECOND ROLL to see whether it hit. The lift IS the
  # throw: if you can get it moving it goes where you aimed it, which is §7's
  # *a blow always connects* said one act over.
  #
  # IT NEEDS NO NEW WRITER. The thing leaves the party's hands through
  # `#put_down!` and the body loses hit points through `#harm!` -- the two
  # statements this class already owns -- in one transaction, and the blow is
  # `#strike!`'s row with `damage:` supplied. So the riposte answers a throw and
  # `Playthrough::Fight` ends on one without either of them knowing what was
  # thrown.
  #
  # THE CHECK IS THE ONE KERNEL. `Character#check` is `d20 <= score - penalty`
  # and the penalty comes off the TARGET, so `Item::BULK` is a parameter on the
  # thing being thrown rather than a second table of numbers -- which is why
  # `bulk` is a closed key. At a target of zero or less NO DIE IS THROWN
  # (`Character::Check#impossible?`) and the throw fumbles, because the pass rate
  # there is zero for ever.
  #
  # WHAT IT COSTS, C8, MEASURED AND STATED: a hit deals one die of the thing's
  # own bulk -- light d4, handy d6, heavy d8 -- so a thrown heavy thing kills an
  # unhurt level-1 d6 body 37.3% of the time, in either direction. See
  # `Item::THROWN_DAMAGE`.
  #
  # `rng:` IS THE SEED, AND THE DEFAULT IS THE ENGINE'S OWN. Both dice come out
  # of ONE generator in one order -- the d20 first, the damage second -- which is
  # `Roll.generator`'s whole contract: a caller throwing several dice for one
  # decision throws them from one seed. A caller may hand its own, which is what
  # pins an outcome in a test where a sweep script honestly cannot.
  #
  # Nil for a throw there is nobody to make or nothing to aim at, and for a body
  # with no abilities -- `Character#check`'s own answer and the same honest
  # nothing `#harm!` gives a body with no stat block.

  # sources had already taken that axis between them -- a check 1..3, a blow
  # counting up off `Playthrough::Blow.next_sequence`, a toll counting down off
  # `Playthrough::Toll.next_sequence`, each unbounded. A throw's identity is not
  # a count of anything, so there was nowhere on that line for it to stand; see
  # `Roll`'s header for the collision that says so in numbers.
  #
  # THE ITEM IS THE SEQUENCE, and it is the honest identity of a throw: two
  # throws of ONE thing at one story moment are one roll, which is exactly the
  # property `#check` is documented under and what makes a throw re-derivable a
  # year from now. Two DIFFERENT things thrown at one moment are two rolls.

  # What the narrator is told, in the app's own words. Stated as done, because
  # it is: the row is already written by the time this is read.
  # AND WHAT IS WRITTEN ON IT, WHEN THE RECORDS ALREADY HOLD THE WORDS. The turn
  # that produced the whole complaint was a `take`, not a read: *"pickup the
  # note. what does it say?"* is one line, the loop does one act, and the act it
  # did was picking the note up. Handing over the words the records already have
  # costs nothing and closes that case; NOT generating them here is the other
  # half of the rule, because picking a thing up is not reading it and a take
  # must not silently become a model call. A readable thing with no words yet is
  # simply not quoted, and the first read writes them.
  #
  # AND IT IS STATED AS A CHANGE RATHER THAN AS A STATE, which is the whole of
  # the take-denied fix of 2026-09-05. It used to read *"Odile Vance has picked
  # up the Ward Office 12 daybook and is now carrying it"* -- a perfect
  # description of where the row now stands and no account at all of where it
  # stood a moment ago. Beside it the engine's `moment` listed the daybook under
  # *"The player is carrying:"*, because by then it truly was, and the two
  # together read as one fact stated twice: the thing is theirs. So the narrator
  # wrote the pickup as redundant -- *"You reach for the daybook, but it is
  # already in your hands"* -- on 19 of 20 judgeable take turns of the
  # 2026-09-05 re-baseline and 14..17 of 18 of the prompt bench's take cases.
  #
  # The sentence now says WHEN (this turn and not before it), WHERE IT WAS
  # (lying in this room, not in their hands) and WHAT TO WRITE (the taking).
  # the engine's `moment::Handled` is the other half and marks the same row on
  # the carried list, so the standing state and the fact agree about which of
  # the two they are.
  #
  # AND IT SAYS WHAT DID NOT MOVE, which is `one line, one act` handed to the
  # prose and was forced by measurement. Prose that finally narrated the pickup
  # started narrating the pickup's SOURCE with it -- *"you reach behind the
  # stack of blank ward forms and draw out the copy-room apron"*, of an apron
  # the records put somewhere else -- and `item_not_held` on take-shaped cases
  # went from 1 flag to 12 over four repetitions (take-fix-1, 2026-09-05). One
  # row moved, so one row is what the sentence lets the paragraph move.

  #
  # The classifier's answer, with one correction: the branch that resolves a
  # THE CLASSIFIER'S ANSWER, AND SINCE 2026-09-05 NOTHING ELSE. It used to carry
  # three corrections -- a `take` with no protagonist, a `drop` with no room and
  # a `throw` with no protagonist -- each of which resolved a record, could not
  # act on it, narrated the attempt and was then recorded as an act on no
  # record. That is how the captain's playthrough 24 came to hold two `take`
  # turns whose `acted_on` was nil beside narration saying the things were in
  # his hands. All three are refused in front of the dispatch now
  # (`Playthrough::Refusal`'s `:unplayable`), so no `Scene` is written at all
  # and there is nothing left to correct.
  #
  # Everything else is recorded exactly as it resolved. An action with no record
  # here is `other`, which resolves to none by design -- a reach that found
  # nothing never reaches this method now, because the turn it would have
  # produced is refused instead (`#refuse`). An `examine` DOES carry one, and
  # keeps it even when the thing turned out to have nothing written on it: the
  # classifier resolved the record, so the turn was a look at THAT stamp.
  # WHO WAS IN THE ROOM WHEN THIS TURN HAPPENED, snapshotted onto the turn.
  #
  # A SNAPSHOT AND NOT THE RECORD. `Playthrough#cast_in` is who is standing
  # there NOW in this game; this is who was there then, and the two are
  # different questions that
  # a single column cannot answer. `Eval::Richness` asks whether a narration
  # named the person who was standing there, `Story::Audit#check_stillness`
  # asks whether anybody was in the room on a run of turns that changed
  # nothing, and both frozen corpora carry the answer beside the prose -- all
  # three read a past moment that the whereabouts column, which has no history,
  # cannot reconstruct. So the join table is KEPT, and only its direction
  # changed: it is written from the records rather than being the only place
  # the records ever lived.
  #
  # AND IT IS THIS GAME'S CAST, not the world's: `Playthrough#cast_in` subtracts
  # whoever this playthrough has killed. Playthrough A recording that it stood
  # in a room with a body it had already put down would be recording a person
  # this game could no longer speak to, while playthrough B goes on meeting them
  # alive -- which is the layer split, and the reason the four readers all come
  # through that one method.
  #
  # Read off `scene.location` rather than `playthrough.current_location`,
