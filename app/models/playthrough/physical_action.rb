# Physical attempts are choices assembled from this game's actual things and
# doorways. A model may select one token, never supply an effect or an amount.
# Rebuild the table before writing: a saved choice is not proof that a tool is
# still carried or a doorway still reachable. Turn journals the write and its
# receipt together, then gives the receipt to the narrator.
#
# Profiles and barriers are world parameters. Spent items and opened passages
# belong to one playthrough. A spent copy remains as a tombstone so visiting
# its template again cannot manufacture another dose or another sheet of paper.
