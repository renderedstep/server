# THE ONE WAY INTO THE TURN LOOP, for every front end.
#
# `Playthrough::Turn` is the loop. This is what stands between it and whatever
# the player is looking at: it starts a game, accepts a typed line, plays it,
# and turns how the turn ended into what the player is told. A front end hands
# it a line and a block, and renders what it answers. It owns its layout, its
# input and its transport and nothing else -- so the browser (`NarrationJob`,
# `PlaythroughsController`, `TurnsController`) keeps Turbo, the request and the
# cable, and every decision about the game or the words for an outcome lives
# here, once. What a front end needs and this does not answer is added here,
# never to the front end. `test/models/playthrough/session_test.rb` holds the
# guard: no front end constructs a `Playthrough::Turn` of its own.
#
# WHY "SESSION" AND NOT "DRIVER". It is one player's hold on one playthrough,
# for as long as they are typing into it, which is what a session is in every
# front end it serves; "driver" would describe the code, not the thing. The
# browser's cookie session is a different object and is not touched here.
#
# THE STREAM IS A PREVIEW; THE PERSISTED SCENE IS THE RECORD. The block receives
# prose as it is generated, and nothing more: the narrator's fallback words are
# never yielded, and a rotation yields both attempts' chunks. So a front end
# redraws the finished turn from `playthrough.turn_log` when `on_finish` is
# called, never from what streamed -- the browser does exactly that by
# replacing `#turn_log` from the records.
#
# It is plumbing. It makes no model call of its own and holds no prompt text:
# every call a turn makes is the loop's.

  # or `:none` -- the same three states the play page draws). `running_turn`
  # is the command still in hand while `busy`, oldest first, so a front end
  # that reconnects mid-turn can find the turn it is waiting on. `finished` is
  # `Playthrough::EndNotice#finished` -- which goal ended a concluded story and
