# WHAT SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT FIGHTING YOU DOES WHILE YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING ELSE.
#
# THE EXACT TWIN OF `Playthrough::NpcAction`, and everything worth knowing
# about the shape is in that class's header: a choice is an opaque token in a
# table built from THIS GAME's records, the table is rebuilt when the answer
# arrives so a stale token cannot act, and the receipt says which token was
# applied or rejected. Read it before changing this.
#
# WHAT IS DIFFERENT IS WHO ASKS AND WHEN. `NpcAction` is reached only from a
# conversation the player started, so a peaceful person standing in a room was
# inert: the world's whole repertoire between two typed lines was one hostile
# swing (`Playthrough::Riposte`). This runs in the riposte's own slot, on the
# room the turn BEGAN in, for everybody in it who is not fighting -- so a
# clerk can walk out while you read a docket, and you turned your back.
#
# AND WHAT DECIDES IT IS A DIE AND NOT A MODEL. `characters.desire_pursuit` is
# one of seven words (`Character::PURSUITS`); `Playthrough::Volition::Weights`
# is what that word does, in code; `Roll` throws the die off this game's own
# seed. Three consequences, all of them the reason it is built this way:
# `rake game:sweep` can walk it, a turn costs nothing extra, and the same turn
# replays the same decision for ever.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IS NOT ON THE LIST, AND WHY EACH ONE IS NOT.
#
#   attack     Hostility is a world column no model and no typed line writes,
#              and `EngineSweep::Invariants#hostility_unmoved` asserts it. A
#              pick that could start a fight would put every peaceful world one
#              roll away from a war. Provoking stays the player's and the
#              world's.
#   speak      Speech is prose, and prose is a streamed model call. A roomful
#              of people all choosing to talk is an unbounded number of them on
#              one turn. A character's act is narrated in the third person by
#              the paragraph the turn already pays for, and the player still
#              has a voice by typing at somebody.
#   accept     There is nobody offering. `accept:` is `NpcAction`'s answer to a
#              gift held out during a conversation, and nothing is held out
#              here.
#   ceasefire  Only somebody fighting you can stop, and nobody fighting you
#              gets a volition -- the riposte acted for them.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# NO WORLD ROW MOVES. Every effect below goes through a writer that touches
# this playthrough's layer only: `Playthrough::NpcState#location` for a walk
# (never `characters.location_id`, which is shared by every game of this world
# and which `EngineSweep::Invariants#cast_unmoved` holds still), and this
# game's own copy of an item for a transfer.
#
# NO PURSUIT, NO BEHAVIOUR, and it is the most important line in the file.
# Somebody the world has stated no `desire_pursuit` for gets no turn at all --
# no roll, no row, no fact (`Playthrough::Volition::Weights.row_for`). Two
# things follow, and both are the point: a world supplying no parameter gets no
# behaviour invented for it, and every story written before these columns
# existed plays exactly as it did yesterday. That is what lets this ship
# without a backfill, and it is why `rake game:backfill_desires` is opt-in
# rather than something a pull runs for you.
#
# AND IT HAS TO RUN IN BOTH PLACES. `Playthrough::Turn#play_serially` and
# `Playthrough::Mechanics#answered_by_the_world`, in the matching slot, or the
# browser and an offline walk disagree about whether the world moved -- the
# note `Playthrough::Arc`'s header makes about itself. It inherits that slot's
# rules whole: a refused line evaluates nothing, an engine-view instrument
# evaluates nothing, and it runs on every line the engine PLAYED.
#
# WHAT THE NARRATOR IS TOLD IS `playthrough_volitions.fact` AND NOTHING ELSE
# (the engine's `moment`): what somebody DID, never why, and
# never what anybody wants. The four objects of desire reach exactly one
# prompt, which is the character's own sheet.

  # WHO IS LEFT OUT:
  #
  #   the player and the protagonist  their act is the line they typed.
  #   the dead                        `#cast_in` has already dropped them.

  #                                   out of this same set. A foe swings; it
  #                                   does not also wander off.
  #
  # ONE TRANSACTION PER CHARACTER AND NEVER ONE FOR THE ROOM, which is two
  # reasons rather than a preference: a rejected pick for one person must not
  # roll back an applied one for another, and SQLite has one writer -- a
  # transaction held across the whole cast is a lock held across the whole
  # cast, on every turn of every game.
  #
  # IT STOPS THE MOMENT THE GAME IS OVER, which is `Playthrough::Riposte`'s
  # rule: a game that is over is a game nothing will ever change again.
  #
  # AND IT STOPS WHILE A CALLER HAS ASKED IT TO HOLD. `hold` is the engine-level
  # switch evaluation staging engages so a typed setup line can rebuild a
  # labelled position without anybody walking out of the room underneath it --
  # see `Eval::Classifier::Stage`. The live game and `EngineSweep::Walk` never
  # enter it; a global constant or environment flag would reach them.
  #
  # THE DIE DECIDES, in this Ruby reference loop. A turn the game plays asks
  # System One first where it is on and lets the die decide whatever it did not
  # (the Rust engine's `volition`): the act, where the answer reads the person
  # pressured enough, and what somebody the speech die let speak up says, with
  # `decided_by` saying which decided and `system_one_error` why the die did
  # when the call failed. This loop,
  # which the test suite plays, has no System One reader, so every row it
  # writes is `DECIDED_BY_DIE`. `line:` is the line the player typed, which
  # only that request reads.
