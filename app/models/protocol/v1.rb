# THE ENGINE'S RECORDS AS THE V1 PROTOCOL SPELLS THEM, and nothing else.
#
# docs/protocol/v1.md is the contract and docs/protocol/v1/ its schemas; this
# is the one place the engine's objects become that JSON, so a field is named
# once. It decides nothing: every value is read from `Playthrough::Session`,
# `Playthrough::Glance` or a record the driver handed over. Ids are opaque
# strings, times are ISO 8601, money is a number of US dollars, and no class
# name, table name or Rails type crosses the wire -- a client written against
# the spec must be able to talk to an engine that is not this one.
#
# WITHIN V1 THIS ONLY GROWS. A field may be added; none is renamed, retyped or
# removed. `test/contract/protocol_v1_test.rb` validates what comes out of
# here against the checked-in schemas.
