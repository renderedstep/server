# HOW ITEMS COME TO EXIST. One class, one entry point, and every `Item` the
# app creates goes through it.
#
# Until this existed nothing in the app made an `Item` at all -- `lib/world_seed/loader.rb`
# was the only writer in the whole codebase -- so every room the world wrote
# for itself was empty and the possession mechanic the app already owns
# (`Playthrough::Turn#take_item` / `#drop_item`) could only be exercised in
# rooms a person had hand-written.
#
# ITEMS ARE BORN AS STRUCTURED RECORDS AT THE MOMENT A ROOM IS REALIZED,
# exactly the way exits are, and NOT by reading narration or by a tool the
# narrator may or may not call. That is the deliberate deviation from the
# direction plan's "populated when the narrator names something": the
# standing constraint is that the engine owns state and the narrator is
# *told* it, so a mechanic whose records depend on a model calling a tool is a
# mechanic that quietly stops working the day a model stops complying. The
# plan's real intent survives -- nothing is generated ahead of time, the
# ontology stays bounded, a stub room costs nothing until somebody walks in --
# and only the compliance dependency is dropped. The engine's `moment` then
# tells the narrator what is lying here, out of these records.
#
# WHOLE, NOT STUBBED. `Location` is realized in two steps because a room's
# description is expensive and a room nobody enters should not be paid for.
# An item is a name and one line, ~15 output tokens, riding on a call that is
# already being made -- so deferring the line would save nothing now and cost
# a whole round trip later, the first time somebody examined it. Items are
# created complete. If an item ever grows a field worth a call of its own,
# that is the point to revisit it, and `Location`'s two-state shape is the
# model to copy.
#
# WHAT IT REFUSES, and every one of these is a candidate a model really can
# produce: a name the room already has, a name anything in this story already
# has, a name that is a person or a place (the closed sets `talk` and `move`
# resolve against -- an "Ashgate Market" lying on the floor makes two of the
# classifier's enums answer to one word), and anything at all once the room or
# the world is at its cap. Refusals are dropped, never raised: a room realized
# with two of the three things the model named is a good room, and a
# realization that threw away its description over an item name would not be.
#
# AND WHAT IS WRITTEN ON THE ONES THAT HAVE WRITING ON THEM. `readable` and
# `inscription` come back in the same structured answer
# (`Location::DetailSchema`) and are stored as records here, so a note is born
# with its words the way a room is born with its exits. Nothing else in the app
# may write an inscription on a thing this did not mark readable -- `Item`
# validates that -- and the one other writer, `Item::Inscriber`, only ever fills
# in a readable thing that arrived with none.
#
# IT WRITES THE WORLD LAYER AND ONLY THE WORLD LAYER. Since the captain's
# ruling of 2026-09-04 an `Item` row is either one of the world's own -- a
# TEMPLATE -- or one playthrough's copy of one, and everything here is a
# template: this is the world writing down what a room contains, which is true
# whether nobody is playing or three people are. A realization triggered mid-game
# writes the templates and THEN the playthrough that triggered it takes its copy
# (`Playthrough::Turn#move_to`), in that order, so the party that opened the door
# sees the room it just paid for and everybody else sees it when they walk in.
# The caps read templates for the same reason: they bound the world's ontology,
# not how many people have looked at it.
#
# AN INSCRIPTION ON A THING MARKED UNREADABLE IS DROPPED AND THE THING IS KEPT,
# which is the same trade every refusal here makes: a stamp that came back with
# words on it is still a good stamp, and losing a room's furniture over a
# contradiction between two fields of one answer would cost more than the
# contradiction does. The words are what goes, because `readable` is the gate
# and a field that disagrees with the gate is not evidence against it.

  # "a physics ontology" is the thing the direction plan rules out, and an
  # unbounded item table is how you get one by accident.
  #
  # 60 is four times the largest seeded world's cast-and-contents and roughly

  # AND THE ROOM WRITER'S OWN THINGS, NOT A KIT'S (`Item.bespoke`). A kit's
  # desk and the pen on it are the engine's closed list, rolled before the

  # two caps bound what a model may propose, and a furnished room still has its
