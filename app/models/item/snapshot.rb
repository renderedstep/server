# THE INITIAL SNAPSHOT ANY PLAYTHROUGH USES, and the only thing in the app that
# creates an `Item` in the playthrough layer.
#
# The captain's ruling of 2026-09-04, verbatim: *"each play through should have
# its own copy of items. If a location is generated with items in it, that
# should become the initial snapshot that any playthrough uses but what happens
# to the items after that should be managed by the playthrough."* This is the
# "initial snapshot" half. `Item::Registry` is still the only writer of the
# world layer; this copies what it wrote, once, per game.
#
# LAZY, AT FIRST CONTACT, AND NEVER AHEAD OF IT. A world generates itself for as
# long as somebody keeps walking, so instantiating a whole story at the moment a
# game begins would copy rooms nobody will ever open and would go stale the
# first time one of them was realized. So the copy happens when the party is
# actually in front of the thing: the room they are standing in at the top of
# every turn (`Playthrough::Turn#play`), the room they have just walked into
# after it is realized (`#move_to`), and the protagonist's own kit when the
# playthrough is created. The `rake game:mechanics` mode calls the same two.
#
# THE GUARD IS PER TEMPLATE, NOT PER ROOM, and that is what makes it correct
# rather than merely idempotent. "This room is done" would be wrong in three
# ordinary ways: a party that takes the ward stamp and walks back in would find
# it re-copied onto the floor; somebody who walks into the room later has
# templates the first visit never saw; and a person who walks in carrying
# something has items the room never had. Asking instead "does this playthrough
# already hold a copy of THIS template" answers all three with one query, and it
# is the question `items(playthrough_id, template_id)` is indexed for.
#
# WHERE A COPY LANDS is where the template is, with ONE stated exception. A
# template lying in a room copies to an instance lying in that room; a template
# in an NPC's hands copies to an instance in that NPC's hands, in this game. A
# template held by the PROTAGONIST copies into THE PARTY'S OWN HANDS -- because
# the protagonist is the player, `Story#starting_inventory` is the world's word
# for what the player starts out holding, and the party is wherever the
# playthrough is rather than wherever a character row says. Companions are NOT
# the exception: `Item.for_character` was never the party's inventory for
# anybody but the protagonist, so a companion's lantern stays in the companion's
# hands exactly like any other person's.
#
# AND WHERE IN THE ROOM IT IS LYING COMES ALONG WITH IT, which is the same
# ruling read one pair of columns further: the template's position IS the
# initial snapshot. It costs this file no line -- `Item::NOT_COPIED` is an
# exception list and `x`/`y` are not on it, which is that constant's own note --
# and it cannot produce an illegal row, because a template with a position is
# lying in a room and a copy of one lies in that same room. What the copy does
# afterwards is the playthrough's: `Playthrough::Turn#carry!` takes it off the
# floor plan and `#put_down!` rolls it a new place, and the world's row stays
# exactly where it was for the next game.
#
# AND WHAT IT LIES ON COMES ALONG AS THIS GAME'S OWN COPY OF IT. A template on
# the world's desk names the world's desk (`within`), and a copy has to name
# this game's copy of that desk instead -- the one thing about a copy that is
# neither brought along nor left behind but translated. So a room's fixtures
# are copied before anything else in it, and a thing whose fixture this game
# holds no copy of standing in the same room is set on the floor rather than
# on somebody else's desk.
#
# NO MODEL, NO NETWORK, NO GENERATION. Every row it writes is a copy of a row
# that already exists.
