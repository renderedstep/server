# README

Text Adventure is a text-based adventure game that generates itself as you
explore, and keeps what it generates. Locations are created on demand and then
persist — walk back into a room and it is the room you left.

## Development setup

```bash
bundle install
bin/rails engine:build   # the Rust engine, which plays every turn: needs cargo and libclang
bin/rails db:prepare
```

`bin/setup` does all three. **A Rust toolchain is required**
([rustup](https://rustup.rs), plus libclang: `libclang-dev` on Debian and
Ubuntu, `clang` on Arch, the Xcode command line tools on macOS), because every
turn is played by the Rust engine; see [The Rust engine](#the-rust-engine).

Generation needs a model. Either:

* **Local** — run `ollama serve` and pull the models listed in
  `BaseAgent::LOCAL_MODEL_OPTIONS` — **off unless `TA_LOCAL_MODELS=1`**. Free, but 40–90 seconds per structured call, and a slow local answer is worse than a loud failure. World building, the benches and the labs only: the Rust engine plays turns on the hosted rotation.
* **Hosted (preferred)** — set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, in a gitignored `.env`
  (loaded by `dotenv-rails`) or a gitignored `.envrc` (loaded by direnv). Much
  faster, and `BaseAgent` prefers it automatically when the key is present. Defaults to `mistralai/mistral-medium-3.1`, falling back to
  `minimax/minimax-m3`. Override with `OPENROUTER_MODEL`.

  Any model you add must support structured outputs — several OpenRouter `:free`
  endpoints accept a schema and answer in prose instead. Check with:

  ```bash
  curl -s https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models \
    | jq '.data[] | select(.id == "MODEL") | .supported_parameters'
  ```

Comparing two test runs? The suite's assertion total moves between identical
runs by design; [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) says why and gives the
per-file comparison to use instead.

## Updating your checkout

One command after a pull, because a world in your database outlives the schema
that made it: a PR that adds a column usually also needs a backfill run against
the rows you already have.

```bash
bin/update              # pull main, install, migrate, apply what the new code needs, report
bin/update --dry-run    # fetch, then say what WOULD happen. Writes nothing at all
bin/update --skip-pull  # "I already pulled, just apply"
```

It pulls the default branch fast-forward only, runs `bundle install` when the
lockfile moved in that range, migrates, then runs the post-update steps —
today's are three backfills, the safe half of `rake game:repair` for every
story, and `rake game:doctor` for the last word. Each step is asked what it
would do before it is asked to do it, and a step with nothing to do says so in
one line, so this is safe to run after every pull rather than only the
suspicious ones.

**What it never does.** It never stashes, resets, checks out, merges, rebases or
forces anything: on a dirty tree or a branch that is not the default one it
prints the reason and stops. It never makes a model call, so it never spends
tokens because you pulled. And it never touches a running process — it *tells*
you to restart your dev server, since a server that was up before a migration
serves models built from the old schema.

The list of steps lives in [`lib/update.rb`](lib/update.rb), in the repo and in
dependency order; its header is how a PR adds one. `rake game:update` is the
same steps without the git and bundler half (`DRY_RUN=1` first, `ONLY=<step>`
for one, `VERBOSE=1` to see what each step is refusing to guess about).

The RubyLLM 2 migration deliberately cannot be rolled back: it transfers
ownership of persisted model, message and tool-call data to RubyLLM 2's schema.
Back up a database you may need to restore before updating; recovery is from
that backup, not `db:rollback`.

## Generate a world

```bash
rake 'game:new[a debt collector in a city built on a dead god]'
rake game:list
```

The premise is optional; without one the model picks its own.

`rake game:list` prints each world's id, title, genre and counts.

## Play a world again from its beginning

```bash
rake 'game:fork[3]'            # DRY_RUN=1 to read it first, TITLE= to name it
```

A world generates itself as you explore it and keeps what it generates, so a
story you have played for a week is no longer the world you generated — which
makes "how does the game read from the first screen" a question you cannot ask
of it any more. `rake game:fork` answers it by making a SECOND story out of the
first one's generation-time world. **Nothing it does touches the story it was
forked from**: its playthroughs, its scenes and the verdicts you recorded on
turns all reference each other and all stay exactly where they are. The fork
lands on the index page with a Play button, costs no model call, and gets a
title nothing else answers to — the loader keys a world on its title, so a fork
under the original's name would rewrite the original instead of copying it.

Where the world comes from depends on when the story was generated.
`rake game:new` now writes a snapshot the moment the world is finished, into
`stories.generation_snapshot` (see `Story::Snapshot` for why a column rather
than a file). A story older than that column has none, so
`Story::Snapshot::Derivation` reads one back out of the records: everything
written before the story was first played is generation, a room play realized
comes back as the stub it was, and what the derivation cannot place with
confidence it says out loud rather than guessing at. `DRY_RUN=1` prints that
reading — rows kept and left behind per table, and every uncertainty — so it can
be read before it is acted on. `rake 'game:snapshot[3]'` freezes a derivation
once it has been read, and `rake game:doctor` judges the fork like any other
world.

## Play it

```bash
bin/rails db:prepare   # three databases: the app's, Solid Queue's, Solid Cable's
bin/rails db:seed      # the checked-in worlds, no model needed
bin/dev                # then open http://localhost:3000
```

`bin/dev` runs both processes the game needs — the web server and the job worker
— under foreman, with both logs interleaved. `PORT=3142 bin/dev` moves the whole
formation if something else already has 3000.

For the terminal client `ta` (renderedstep/terminal),
start it with `bin/dev --ta`: the same two processes on port 3100, which is the
address `ta` is configured with (`engine_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3100"`). It
stops first if the engine extension is not built, and warns if it is older than
the pinned engine, since `ta` plays every turn through it and would otherwise
see only a 500. `ta` also needs a player token from `rake players:invite[name]`
below, stored once with `ta login`. An explicit `PORT` still wins over `--ta`.

Why two: **a turn is a `NarrationJob`, not a request.** The browser posts the
command, gets an acknowledgement back immediately (a fresh submission token;
`play.js` echoes the typed line itself), and reads the prose as Turbo
Streams broadcast over Action Cable while the job writes it — which is what makes
a turn survive the tab closing, and what stops a twenty-second model call from
holding a Puma thread. So a web process alone accepts a command and then nothing
ever arrives; the turn sits in `storage/development_queue.sqlite3` waiting for a
worker, and starting one later runs the turns you already typed.

`bin/rails server` on its own is still the right thing when you want to debug —
foreman gives its children no TTY, so `binding.break` cannot take the terminal
under `bin/dev`. Pair it with `bin/jobs` in a second terminal when you want to
actually play.

Development uses `solid_cable`, not the `async` adapter the Rails default
suggests: the turn is broadcast from the job worker and read by a WebSocket held
in Puma, and `async` broadcasts only within one process. On `async` the player
watches an empty cursor and the turn lands in silence.

There is still no Node, no `package.json` and no build step. `propshaft` serves
`app/javascript` as it sits on disk, `importmap-rails` lets the browser resolve
the module names itself, and foreman is a process runner rather than a build
step — deliberately outside the Gemfile, installed on demand by `bin/dev`. The
one build is the Rust engine's extension, which plays every turn
([The Rust engine](#the-rust-engine)).

### Use things and open passages

Describe your attempt in ordinary text, or use a slash command to select it
directly. The available actions come from the items you carry, the people
present, and the room's actual doorways. These examples require the named
things and their corresponding physical profiles in your world:

| command | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/consume healing draught` | Consume a carried dose and restore hit points up to your maximum. `/eat` and `/drink` also select consumption; ordinary food and drink do not heal wounds. |
| `/offer brass key to Maren` | Ask the character to accept a carried item. They may refuse; ownership changes only if they accept. `/give` is an alias. |
| `/burn letter with tinderbox` | Destroy a combustible item you carry or that lies in this room, using a carried firestarter. |
| `/unlock Storeroom with brass key` | Open a keyed doorway using its matching key. |
| `/pick Storeroom with lockpicks` | Try a dexterity check against a keyed doorway. |
| `/pry Loft with iron lever` | Try a strength check against a jammed doorway using a carried lever. |
| `/force Loft` | Try to force a jammed doorway with a penalized strength check. |

Opening a doorway leaves you in the room. Use a separate `/move Storeroom` to
cross it. A failed check leaves the barrier closed; a successful opening applies
in both directions in your game. Other playthroughs keep their own locks, and a
moving city's doorway keeps its lock and your opening when its destination moves.
Keys and opening tools remain in your hands.

Consumption and burning spend that game's copy permanently. Revisiting or
re-seeding the room cannot provide another dose or restore a burned letter;
another playthrough starts with its own intact copy. Offering an item transfers
ownership if accepted; it does not consume or apply the item for the recipient.

Newly generated items receive closed physical profiles. Existing items remain
`ordinary` until a profile is explicitly supplied; a name or description that
mentions medicine does not create a healing effect. Healing amounts come from
`Item::HEALING_POINTS`. Door barriers and their matching keys are authored in
seed files; generation currently creates open passages. See the
[physical item parameters](db/seeds/worlds/README.md#use_kind-and-combustible-physical-parameters)
and [door barriers](db/seeds/worlds/README.md#barrier-and-key_template-a-doorways-initial-state).

## Play over the engine API

A client in another process (a terminal client, say) plays through `/api/v1`,
an HTTP + Server-Sent Events protocol. [docs/protocol/v1.md](docs/protocol/v1.md)
is the contract and `docs/protocol/v1/openapi.json` its schemas. Players are
invited, not signed up, and each has a monthly spend limit the engine enforces
before it accepts a turn:

```bash
rake players:invite[ada]          # prints ada's token once; LIMIT_USD=2 to change the default of $1
rake players:limit[ada,2.50]      # dollars a calendar month
rake players:revoke[ada]          # the token stops working; games and receipts are kept
```

`TA_HOSTED_API_ONLY=1` boots an instance that serves only `/api/v1`, the model
relay and `/up`: no play page, no debug, map, lab or machinery, and no cable.
Bind it to a loopback address and put whatever reaches it in front; the app
assumes no address of its own.

**The model relay** lets an engine running on a player's own machine use the
instance's OpenRouter key, under the same player token and the same monthly
limit. It serves OpenRouter's two routes under `/relay/openrouter`, and only
when `RELAY_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set. That is a separate variable from
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, so an instance can play with one key and relay with
another. [docs/protocol/relay.md](docs/protocol/relay.md) is the contract.

## Play the mechanics on their own

`rake game:mechanics` walks a world with **the narration switched off**, on the
engine the game plays: every line is one turn of the Rust engine's own no-model
turn (`EngineSweep::RustMechanics`, the same one the offline sweep walks), and
what it left is read back off the records.

```bash
rake 'game:mechanics[The Unrecorded Hour]'   # or by id: rake 'game:mechanics[2]'
```

```
> take stamp
  understood: take -> ward stamp
  read by:    grammar
  changed:    took: ward stamp (was lying in Ward Office 12, now carried by Odile Vance)
Ward Office 12 [#11, realized]
  exits       The Supply Closet [realized], The Long Hallway [stub]
  lying here  blank closure writ [#13], filing press [#14]
  carrying    Ward Office 12 daybook [#12], ward stamp [#15]
  present     Halkett Rowe
```

**Why it exists.** A turn that goes wrong could have gone wrong in the
classifier, in the prose, or in the engine underneath, and all three arrive
together. This takes the first two away: there is no model at all, so nothing
is generated, no key is needed, and nothing reaches the network.

A fixed grammar replaces the classifier and nothing is generated: `go <exit>`,
`take <item>`, `drop <item>`, `talk <person>` (also `speak`, `ask`),
`inspect <item>` (also `read`, `examine`, `x`, `look at`), `attack <person>` (also `hit`,
`strike`), `throw <item> at <person|exit>` (also `hurl`, `toss`),
`look` (also `where`, `inventory`, `exits`, `items`, `who`), `help`,
`quit`. Talking is prose and this
mode still writes none, so `talk` names whoever it resolved and stops — but
**whether** it resolves is an engine question, and since presence became a
record it is one that can be answered with no model at all. `read` is the same
argument one step further: what is written on a thing is a record too, so it
prints `Item#inscription` straight out and refuses a thing with nothing written
on it. It will not *write* the words a readable thing lacks — that is one model
call, and this mode makes none on that branch. A typed name is matched against
the records
exactly, then as an unambiguous prefix, then as an unambiguous fragment **read
both ways round** — so `take daybook` finds the "Ward Office 12 daybook" and
`drop the tide-slate` finds the "Assize tide-slate" — with a leading
`the`/`a`/`an`/`to`/`into`/`through`/`onto`/`at` dropped before any of that.
Anything unknown or ambiguous is a refusal listing what would have worked. An
exit name typed on its own is a move, so a world whose exits are called `north`
can be walked that way. A move stands the player in a stub without writing it,
and says so.

A turn with the models -- the classifier reading free text, a room written as
you walk into it, the prose -- is the browser's (`bin/dev`), which plays
through the same engine.

### Walking a whole fight

`attack <person>` is the engine's own verb — like `harm`, `mend` and `check` it
never goes to the classifier, so a whole fight is reachable with no key at all.
**Anyone can be attacked**, not only the world's monsters, and swinging at
somebody makes them your enemy for this playthrough and no other.

```
> attack Marek Sollen
  understood: attack -> Marek Sollen
  read by:    grammar
  changed:    struck: Isbet Marrow hit Marek Sollen for 7 (round 1); Marek Sollen is badly hurt (3 of 10)
  answered: Marek Sollen hit Isbet Marrow for 9 (round 1); Isbet Marrow is badly hurt (9 of 18)
The Bell of Saint Aravel [#20, realized]
  exits       Grenn's Boarding House hallway [stub]
  lying here  nothing to pick up
  carrying    nothing
  present     Marek Sollen
  foes        Marek Sollen
  provoked    Marek Sollen
  condition   badly hurt (9 of 18)
  others      Marek Sollen badly hurt (3 of 10)
  sheet       level 3, d8, strength 11 dexterity 14 will 13

> attack Marek
  understood: attack -> Marek Sollen
  changed:    struck: Isbet Marrow hit Marek Sollen for 5 (round 2); Marek Sollen is dead
  the fight is over: The fight in The Bell of Saint Aravel is over after 2 rounds. Marek Sollen is dead. ...
The Bell of Saint Aravel [#20, realized]
  lying here  bell-rope tally [#7]
  present     nobody else
  foes        nobody hostile
```

**A blow always connects** and deals one die of the attacker's hit die. **A
round is the turn**: you act by typing, and then every live foe in the room acts
— on any line the engine played, including a look or a walk out of the door, so
you can leave a fight and it costs you one more exchange. What a body was
carrying lands on the floor when it dies, and the whole exchange is written down
in `playthrough_blows` with **one** `Scene` closing the fight when it ends.

### Throwing something

`throw <item> at <person|exit>` is the only line in the game that names **two**
records — the thing, out of what you are carrying *plus what is lying here*, and
the aim, out of who is standing here and then the ways out. Picking it up is part
of the throw and not a turn of its own.

**One roll, and no second roll to see whether it hit.** A d20 under your
strength, less what the thing weighs — `light` 0, `handy` 2, `heavy` 5 — and if
it leaves your hands it goes where you aimed it. A hit deals one die by bulk
(light d4, handy d6, heavy d8), lands the thing at their feet, and is a **blow**
like any other: they are your enemy from that moment and they answer in the same
turn.

```
> throw the filing press at Halkett Rowe
  understood: throw -> filing press at Halkett Rowe
  read by:    grammar
  refused:    The filing press is immovable and does not move for anybody: it cannot
              be picked up and thrown at all, so no die was thrown for it. Nothing has changed.

> throw the ward stamp at Halkett Rowe
  understood: throw -> ward stamp at Halkett Rowe
  changed:    it hit Halkett Rowe for 3 and is lying at their feet; Halkett Rowe is hurt (5 of 8)
  threw: ward stamp at Halkett Rowe -- strength -> d20(5) <= 9 PASS
  answered: Halkett Rowe hit Odile Vance for 2 (round 1); Odile Vance is hurt (16 of 18)

> throw the daybook at the supply closet
  understood: throw -> Ward Office 12 daybook at The Supply Closet
  threw: Ward Office 12 daybook at The Supply Closet -- strength -> d20(14) <= 7 FAIL
  the lift failed: nothing was thrown and no row moved
```

Four outcomes, and only one of them is a refusal. **A failed lift is a turn you
spent**: it costs story time, it is narrated, and the thing stays exactly where
it was. **Something immovable is refused** — no die, no row, no clock, because
nothing happened. A throw through a doorway leaves the thing lying in the next
room, waiting for whoever walks in.

**A thrown heavy thing kills an unhurt level-1 body 37% of the time**, in either
direction. It is the most lethal act in the game, which is why the seeded
protagonists carry 18 hit points.

### What it writes, and what it never does

Both modes write `playthroughs.current_location_id`, `items.playthrough_id` /
`items.location_id` and, in a fight, `playthrough_vitals` and
`playthrough_blows` — through `Playthrough::Turn#move_to`, `#stand_in!`,
`#carry!`, `#put_down!`, `#harm!`, `#strike!` and `#throw_item!`, **the same statements the
narrated loop moves the world with**, and the closed sets come from `Playthrough::Classifier`'s own readers. A
mechanics mode with its own copy of the line that moves the player would be
testing itself.

It starts a **fresh playthrough** each session rather than editing whichever one
was last played, so it sees **the world as it was written**: it takes its own
copy of every room it walks
into, so nothing it picks up or puts down is visible to the browser and nothing
another game did is visible to it. What stays shared is the world itself — the
rooms, the exits, the cast, and the world's own rows lying in them.
`PLAYTHROUGH=<id or token> rake 'game:mechanics[2]'` attaches to an existing
playthrough when inspecting a real game is the point.

`Playthrough::Mechanics` is the whole of it.
`test/models/playthrough/mechanics_test.rb` runs the offline half with
`BaseAgent.new` raising, and drives the classifier half through a `FakeAgent`
whose queued responses *are* the calls the mode is allowed to make — so a
narrator call it must not make fails the suite instead of passing quietly.

## Sweep the engine

```bash
rake game:sweep                             # every stored script
rake game:sweep SCRIPT=the-salt-assizes-grammar   # one of them
```

The same offline game, walked by **stored scripts instead of by a person**, on
the Rust engine every player plays, with expectations asserted against the
records after every line. It is what the mechanics console is for once you have
stopped watching it: free, deterministic, offline, and it runs in `bin/rails
test` so the engine is regression-tested on every build. It needs the extension
built (`bin/rails engine:build`), and says so rather than walking anything else.

It prints one line per script — `ok` or a failure, the script's name, how many
steps it walked and the world it left intact — and then a single `PASSED` or
`FAILED` line totalling the typed lines and the scripts behind them.

A script is a YAML fixture in `lib/engine_sweep/scripts/` — a world named by
title, an ordered list of lines somebody could have typed, and after any of them
a block of facts somebody could have read off the screen:

```yaml
story: The Salt Assizes
steps:
- id: drop-the-tide-slate
  type: drop the tide-slate
  why: an article in front of a fragment, and the fragment is the tail of the name
  expect:
    changed: true
    understood: drop -> Assize tide-slate
    location: The Causeway Court (realized)
    exits: [The Tide Post (realized), The Vestry Hulk (stub)]
    here: [Assize tide-slate]
    carrying: []
    present: [Ammon Brace]
```

The title resolves to a checked-in world in `db/seeds/worlds` first, and to one
of the sweep's own in `lib/engine_sweep/worlds` second — same format, same
loader, same `rake game:doctor`, but not a world a fresh clone gets, because it
exists to give one assertion something to stand on rather than to be played.
`the-quay-house.yml` is one: two places with their insides laid out, which none
of the playable worlds has — the custom house, which goes up, and the bonded
cellar, whose rooms stand on storeys −1, 0 and 1, so one building spans both
directions from its own way in. `the-iron-gate-descends.yml` is the other, and
it is the first **generated** world with an offline test of any kind — exported
out of a real `rake game:new` story with `rake game:export`, repaired by hand
until its own premise was reachable, and walked from its opening room in through
a laid-out interior to the person the story is about.
`EngineSweep::WORLDS` says why neither is a fourth file in the seed directory.

`present:` is who the records place in the room — the closed set `talk` resolves
against — and `foes:` is which of them means the party harm
(`Playthrough#foes_in`, the world's `characters.hostile` narrowed by this game's
dead). They are asserted separately because they are two facts. `storey:` is the
same idea one axis over: which floor of its place the room stands on, read off
`locations.z` — a signed index, so `0` is the ground floor and `-1` the cellar —
asserted apart from `location:` because a walk can arrive in the right room
having gone the wrong way vertically. It could not be swept until
`characters.location_id` existed: who was in a room was reconstructed from the
last scene there that recorded a cast, and an offline walk writes no scenes at
all, so presence was invisible here by construction and the only place to
observe it was a generated run costing money.
`the-salt-assizes-presence.yml` walks the Tide Post defect for free.

`EngineSweep::Expectation::KEYS` is the whole vocabulary — where the player
stands, whether that room is written and which `storey` of its place it is on,
what leads out of here (`exits`, `exits_include`, `exits_exclude`, each with the
detail level), what is lying here, what is carried, who is standing here
(`present`) and which of them is a foe (`foes`), what the records say is written
on a named thing (`inscription`), whether the line `changed` anything or was
`refused`, what the refusal `offers` as an alternative, how the engine
`understood` the line, and how many `drifts` rows it wrote. **A key outside that
list raises**, so a fixture typo cannot become an expectation that silently
holds.

After every walk a set of **invariants** is checked over the whole world against
the file it was loaded from. The oldest of them are the shape the generator
defects of 2026-09-03 had — no door was opened or closed, no room leads more
ways out than `Location::ExitsSchema::MAX_EXITS`, every item is in exactly one
place, and no room got written; nobody typed a line that gave The Supply Closet
a second door. The ones added since hold that same line over everything else a
typed line must not move. `EngineSweep::Invariants`' header is the whole list,
each with what it is for.

Three things make it repeatable. **No model**: `BaseAgent.new` is replaced for
the length of the run, so a call from anywhere raises instead of reaching a
provider. **Its own copy of the world**: the seed file is loaded under a title of
the sweep's own, on a scratch copy of the database that is deleted when the walk
is done, so running it against a half-played database changes neither it nor the
game. **A world that does not
move underneath it**: `WorldMechanic` runs on `Story#clock`, the clock only
advances when a Scene is written, and an offline move writes none — so The Lunar
Cartographer's nightly shuffle never comes due, without anything being switched
off to achieve that.

What it cannot see is said out loud in the scripts themselves: with the
classifier off, a defect in how a *model* read the line is out of reach and stays
pinned by `Playthrough::ClassifierTest`. See `lib/engine_sweep.rb` and
`lib/engine_sweep/scripts/regressions-2026-09-03.yml`, which walks the evening
that produced all of this and says defect by defect how far the walk gets.

## The Rust engine

Every turn is played by the Rust engine,
[renderedstep/engine](https://github.com/renderedstep/engine) (MIT OR
Apache-2.0): the same rules and the same dice over this app's SQLite schema.
`Playthrough::Session` hands it each whole turn through a native extension, so
the browser, the `/api/v1` API and anything else that plays through the session
play on Rust, while Turbo, the labs, the benches, the doctor, repair, seeding
and every backfill stay Ruby on the same database. What a front end shows
between turns is read off the engine as well: the panels and which verbs are
open at what (`Playthrough::Glance`, `Playthrough::Availability`), the slash
menu, and the narration scaffold the prompt version digests all come from one
extension call (`Playthrough::RustEngine.glance`, `.scaffold`), so the panel
offers exactly what the engine plays.

**The extension is required to play, and so is a Rust toolchain to build it.**
It is not a gem and not in the Gemfile: it is a crate in `ext/renderedstep`
that depends on the engine at one pinned commit (`ext/renderedstep/Cargo.toml`,
with `Cargo.lock` committed), built into `ext/renderedstep/build/`, which is
gitignored. `bin/setup` builds it, `bin/update` rebuilds it whenever the crate
moved in what it pulled or the build stamp `engine:build` leaves beside the
library does not name the pinned engine and crate (`Update::EngineStamp`), and
the Dockerfile builds it in its build stage, so the image itself carries no
toolchain.

```bash
bin/rails engine:build          # cargo build --release --locked, then into ext/renderedstep/build/
PORT=3142 bin/dev               # play; restart after a rebuild
bin/dev --ta                    # the same, on 3100, for the terminal client `ta`
ENGINE_SOURCE=../engine bin/rails engine:build   # against a local checkout of the engine instead
```

**There is no fallback.** A turn the engine cannot play fails, in the engine's
own words, as the turn's failure notice; it is logged, counted in the process
(`Playthrough::RustEngine.failures`), published as `failure.rust_engine`, and
never played again on Ruby. That covers an extension that is not built or does
not load, and every engine error: a schema it is not written against, a rule it
does not play yet, a database failure, a panic it caught. A model failure is
not an engine error; the player is told what they have always been told (the
crisis notice, the setup notice, the failure copy). The engine's model calls
use the credentials the app uses: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` as its Direct route,
`OPENROUTER_MODEL`, and the System One keys; neither side logs them. The local
rotation (`TA_LOCAL_MODELS`) is not the engine's, so it never reaches a turn.
`app/models/playthrough/rust_engine.rb` says all of this at the source.

**The engine owns behaviour.** The goldens a Rust walk is held to
(`test/engine_parity/<script>.json`) are the engine's own: its parity binary
writes them, and a change to a rule rewrites them there as a reviewed diff. This
repository vendors them, with the sweep scripts and the vector portions the
engine owns, byte for byte at the pinned commit, and moves them only with the
pin. They were written by the Ruby turn loop until the engine took them over;
the commit tagged `ruby-reference-final` is where every turn moved to Rust, and
every golden it holds was unchanged when the engine took them over. `Playthrough::Turn` is still in the
code, for its own tests and nothing else: the test suite plays the engine, and a
test that plays a turn does it on a scratch copy of the database, where the
engine, on its own connection, can read what the test wrote (`PlaysOnRust`).
`test/ruby_loop_coverage.yml` names, for each of the Ruby loop's tests, what
holds the engine to the same behaviour. Every request the Ruby loop sends is
the engine's (`Playthrough::Requests`). The benches and the
mechanics console play on the engine. No setting turns the Ruby loop on for a
player, and no gate judges the engine against it.

**The benches measure what the game sends.** Every request a bench measures
is built by the engine through the extension: `rake eval:prompt` plays each
case as a whole engine turn with the reading fixed, on a scratch copy of the
database, and sends the calls that turn makes; the classifier bench reads each
line through the engine's own classifier and cascade; the dialogue, arrival
and volition benches build their requests from the staged rows. The words
those requests carry have one home, the engine's `data/`, which this app reads
from the extension (`EngineData`) and keeps no copy of.

**The judges stay Ruby.** The sweep's expectations and invariants, the doctor
and the audit read the rows the engine wrote; none of them asks the engine what
it thinks it did. What the doctor and the audit say after each script is kept
beside its golden (`<script>.checks.json`), first written from the Ruby loop
where the two engines were judged alike, and changed only as a reviewed diff
(`bin/rails engine:checks`).

**The gates**, all offline and all run by CI (the sweep by the `test` job, the
rest by the `rust_engine` job):

```bash
unset OPENROUTER_API_KEY TYPESAFE_API_KEY
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:test:prepare
bin/rails game:sweep                         # every script on Rust, its expectations and the invariants
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails engine:vendored     # the vendored files are the pinned commit's
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails engine:rust_gates   # SCRIPT=<name> for one
bin/rails engine:kept_requests
```

`engine:vendored` fails when a golden, a sweep script (less its comments and
`why:` notes) or an engine-owned vector portion here is not the pinned engine
commit's, byte for byte, reading the source cargo fetched for the build.
`engine:rust_gates` plays every sweep script through the extension, one step at
a time on a scratch copy of the test database. It fails when a step's dump, as
Ruby reads the rows, differs from its golden, when the engine could not play a
step, when an `EngineSweep::Invariants` check breaks on the database Rust wrote,
or when `Story::Doctor` or `Story::Audit` says anything its checks file does not.
`engine:kept_requests` runs the engine's own vector tests, at the pinned commit,
against this checkout's `test/engine_vectors/`: every pure rule and request
builder, and every kept-set request sent through the engine's live client with
nothing sent anywhere. Moving the pin is a change of its own, made when these
pass on the new commit; docs/engine-parity.md says how a behaviour change moves
through both repositories.

## How a turn works

The loop is `Playthrough::Turn` (`app/models/playthrough/turn.rb`). It lives in
`app/models` so that no front end owns it: every front end reaches it through
one driver, `Playthrough::Session`, and its whole share of a turn is handing the
session a string and a block to write chunks into — there is no `rake game:play`.

Read the colours first. **Purple is a model call. Teal is the app deciding from
records it already holds. Orange is a gap — something not built yet.** That
distinction is the one to get right, and it is a standing architectural
principle here: *nothing depends on the narrator complying.* A model that
answers badly must not be able to move the player, so every branch below is
taken on a record the app is holding, never on a label a model wrote.

**A slashed line is read by the grammar first and by the model second.** The
**`/` is the whole of the claim**: a line carrying one goes to
`Playthrough::Grammar` — a
closed verb table and a name matched against **the same closed set the
classifier would have been offered** — and reaches `Playthrough::Classifier` only
when that could not place the noun; **a line without one is not claimed at all,
whatever it begins with**, and costs exactly what it always did.
`scenes.resolved_by` records which reader answered. The slash is input syntax
and is stripped before the line is read, so `Scene#typed` and every instrument
that reads it go on seeing ordinary English; the browser's box writes it
(`Playthrough::SlashMenu`), which makes the shortcut opt-in and visible.

**The key is the switch, and there is no feature flag.** Where either
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is in this environment, a line that
reaches the classifier is read first by the engine's System One cascade —
one System One request, composed into an `Intent` by the engine and never
trusted as one. TypeSafe direct is preferred when its key is present; otherwise
OpenRouter Decisions answers. Where neither key is present there is no cascade
at all: the classifier is byte for byte what it has always been, which is what
every test run and every keyless checkout exercises. See
`Playthrough::Classifier::PATHS`, the engine's `src/cascade.rs` for the two
thresholds, and `EVALUATION.md` -> The classifier bench -> Measuring the
cascade for the failure policy and the kept set.

**The teal box above the arc is everybody else in the room, and it is teal for
the reason it matters most.** Before it, a peaceful person standing in a room
was inert: the world's whole repertoire between two typed lines was one hostile
swing. Now every present character picks one token off a set the app rebuilt
from this game's own records a millisecond earlier, and the app applies it —
which means a clerk can walk out while you read a docket. **What a person is
after is world data with two halves, and only one of them is a branch.** The
four sentences (`conscious_desire`, `unconscious_desire`, `recognized_need`,
`unrecognized_need`) are prose that reaches exactly one prompt — the
character's own sheet — and nothing in the app ever parses one. The two labels
(`desire_pursuit`, `need_pursuit`) are picked from a closed list of seven, and
what a label *does* is a table in code (`Playthrough::Volition::Weights`) — a
world supplying a parameter and never a behaviour. **Where the world supplies
no label there is no behaviour**, so every story written before the columns
existed plays exactly as it did. And a walk writes
`playthrough_npc_states.location`, never `characters.location_id`: the world
layer does not move, which `rake game:sweep` asserts after every script
(`cast_unmoved`, `desires_unmoved`, `volitions_moved_what_they_named`).

**The two teal boxes at the bottom are the arc, and they are teal for the
reason every other teal box is.** Where the story is going is records — `Quest`,
its beats and its endings — and whether a beat has been reached is four record
predicates the app evaluates after every line it PLAYED (a refused line writes
nothing, so it cannot reach a beat). No model is asked what happened, and the
game being over is never a model's decision. The narrator is told exactly one
thing about any of it while a game is still being played: the next open beat's
one-line summary, which is a fact the engine owns, rendered — the same shape as
telling it what is lying on the floor. It is never told the conclusion, because
a model told the ending writes toward an ending the engine has not recorded,
which is the railroad by the back door.

**The purple box under them is the one place a model is asked about an ending,
and it is a rendering rather than a decision.** By the time it runs the outcome
is selected, the playthrough is ended and the closing `Scene` already carries the
outcome's own sentence — so the call is handed a fact and asked for prose, and
every way it can fail leaves the sentence standing (`Scene::Ending`). The
narrator renders a recorded conclusion; it never chooses one. The objection
above is spent by then: there is no next turn to be written toward
anything. **The stored sentence is what an offline walk reaches**, because
`rake game:sweep` makes no call at all — which is how *a game ends with words*
gets asserted with no model in the room
(`lib/engine_sweep/scripts/an-ending-with-words.yml`).

The orange box is the honest one. It is where classifications with nothing more
specific to do end up; every engine-owned effect now has factual fallback prose
after the engine commits its receipt.

**The refusal branch is teal, and that is the point of it. One line, one act:**
a line that attempts more than one act is refused rather than partly executed,
and an unresolved act asks for clarification. The mechanics write those
responses without asking the narrator.

Five shapes stop in front of the dispatch and no model is asked to write
them: a line naming two things the records both have, a reach the closed sets
cannot answer, a classifier answer outside the intent table that still named
a record, a `take` or `throw` of something the world says is **immovable**, and
an attempt to cross or throw through a passage the game still has closed. The
last two shapes are facts about records rather than about the reading, and have
nothing to do with the classifier. A *look* is in the first of those
and never the second — since a look
resolves a record it can name two things, and it was never reaching for one it
could miss, so "read the note and the index" is refused and "look at the sky"
is narrated. `Playthrough::Refusal` is the one author of what the player reads, and
both front ends read it — the browser gets the sentence plus what *is* here,
`rake game:mechanics` gets the sentence and prints the records underneath as it
always did. A refused line writes nothing at all: no row moves, no `Scene`
exists, `Location#last_protagonist_visit` is untouched and `Story#clock` does
not advance, because nothing happened. A refusal read by the classifier still
leaves its measurement — the `Playthrough::Overreach` or
`Playthrough::Drift` row is taken inside `Playthrough::Classifier#classify`
before the loop asks whether it will play the line. A slash command resolved by
the fixed grammar makes no classifier call and writes neither counter. The
refusal rule changes what a model-read turn does, not what the classifier
counts.

The branch it replaced was `Playthrough::Turn#reach_fact`, which told the
narrator that a failed reach had changed nothing and let it write the turn
anyway. That was the right answer while a failed reach still had to produce
prose; it also had a known cost — a classifier miss on a real exit read as prose
denying a door that is there — and refusing writes nothing instead.

**The `take` / `drop` branch is the principle in its shortest form.** The row
moves before any prose exists, out of a set the app closed — what the records
say is lying in this room, or what they say the player is carrying — and the
narrator is then handed the fact and asked for a sentence. So a narration that
says the player pocketed something is a *sentence about* a state change and
never the state change itself, and there is no wording that can grant an item
the app did not. Both directions are owned, deliberately: an app that owns
picking up but lets the narrator assert putting down has records that go stale
the first time a player sets something on a table.

### How things come to exist

That branch was real over a set that was usually empty. Until `Item::Registry`
landed, the only thing in the whole codebase that created an `Item` was the seed
file loader — so `take` and `drop` were exercisable in rooms a person had
hand-written, and **every room the world wrote for itself was empty.**

Things are now born the way exits are: **as structured records, at the moment a
room is realized.** `Location::DetailSchema` asks for the description, the lore
and *at most three portable things lying here* in one answer, and
`Item::Registry` turns the names into rows. It is the same call — a realization
still costs two, and a room the model furnished with nothing costs nothing
extra. (A room inside a laid-out place costs **one**: its doors are already the
engine's, so no exits call is made — the diagram's `M4`.)

**It is deliberately not a narrator tool and not a scan of narration prose.**
Those were the obvious two ways to do it and both make the record depend on a
model complying with a prompt; the standing constraint here is the other way
round — *gate the state, inform the prose.* So the engine decides what exists
and the moment then **tells** the narrator what is lying here, out of
the records, the same way it already tells it the exits and the inventory.

The model proposes and the registry disposes. It refuses, without failing the
realization:

| refused | why |
| --- | --- |
| a name anything in this story already has | the classifier resolves a take by name; two things answering to one word is an ordering accident |
| a name a person or a place has | two of the classifier's closed sets would answer to one word |
| anything past `Item::Registry::MAX_PER_ROOM` (3) | the cap is on the **room**, read from the records — a seeded room can already be at it |
| anything past `Item::Registry::MAX_PER_STORY` (60) | three per room is three per room *times however far the player walked*; this is the ceiling on the ontology |

Both caps count **the world's own rows only.** Every playthrough holds its own
copy of all of it, so counting copies would spend a room's budget of three on
one thing three players had each seen once.

A refusal costs the room its furniture and never its description — by then the
expensive half of the call is already saved. The room is asked for at most what
is left of its allowance, so a refusal after the fact is the exception rather
than the routine.

Items are created **whole, not stubbed.** `Location` is realized in two steps
because a room's description is expensive and a room nobody walks into should
not be paid for. An item is a name and one line riding on a call already being
made, so deferring the line would save ~15 output tokens now and cost a whole
round trip the first time somebody examined it.

### Things that can be read

A note, a letter, a sign, a docket, a label: **what is written on it is a
record.** `items.readable` says a thing has words on it and `items.inscription`
holds them, bounded at 400 characters.

A recorded turn exposed the gap: the player typed *"pickup the note. what does
it say?"* and the narrator answered *"Midnight. The Bell. They know about the
maps."* — invented on the spot, kept nowhere, and free to be something different
the next time the note was unfolded. Writing on an item therefore belongs in
the durable game state.

The words are written in exactly two places and read everywhere:

| written by | when |
| --- | --- |
| `Item::Registry` | at room realization, out of the same answer that named the thing — `Location::DetailSchema` asks for `readable` and, when it is true, the text itself |
| a seed file | `readable: true` plus `inscription:` under any item, hand-authored (`db/seeds/worlds/README.md`) |
| `Item::Inscriber` | **once**, on the first read of a readable thing that arrived with no words. One structured call, one field, before any prose exists |

`readable` is the whole gate. Nothing generates text for a thing the world did
not mark readable — ask to read a ward stamp and you get a look at a ward stamp,
now and forever. `Item` refuses an inscription on anything unreadable outright.

**Reading is a branch of the loop, not a prompt.** `Playthrough::Classifier`
gives `examine` a resolved target against what is lying here **plus** what the
player carries — the only action that reads both sets, because looking at a
thing does not move it — and `Playthrough::Turn#read_item` hands the narrator
the recorded words *verbatim and quoted*, the way `take` hands it the pickup.
The turn is recorded in `scenes.resolved_action` / `scenes.acted_on` like any
other. A `take` of a thing whose words are already on record hands them over
too, because that is the shape of the turn that produced the complaint; it never
*generates* them, because picking a thing up is not reading it.

So the second reading of a note is a database read. The same string, both
times, and no model in the loop at all.

`Story::Audit`'s `inscription_misquoted` is the third clause: prose that quotes
what is written on a thing whose words the records hold, and quotes it
differently. Measured for false positives on all 367 real passages in the four
corpora — 92 of them quote somebody, and it flags none of them — with the
recorded narration as the positive case. See
`test/models/story/audit/inscription_test.rb`.

`Item.lying_in` is unchanged, so the closed set `take` resolves against picks
generated things up with no further change, in the browser and in
`rake game:mechanics` alike. `rake game:doctor` reports the states the registry
refuses but an older world can still be in: items nowhere, duplicate names,
rooms and worlds over the caps, and an item named after a person or a place.

### Where people are

The people half of the same question, and it had the same shape of answer
missing. A `Character` belonged to a story and to the scenes it appeared in, and
that was the whole of what the app knew about **where Ammon Brace is**. So who
was in a room was worked out again on every arrival — the protagonist, anyone
`is_companion`, and whoever was in the last scene played there that recorded a
cast — and only an arrival records one, so 184 of the 480 turns on the baseline
had no record of who was present at all.

A cast that is regenerated is a cast that forgets. Arriving at **The Tide Post**
recorded the protagonist alone, on all three runs checked, in a world whose
entire premise is that Neb Halloran is chained to that post. The narrator put
him there, correctly and unfalsifiably; no record kept him.

`characters.location_id` is the `Item` shape applied to people — **one place at
a time, and the app owns it**:
