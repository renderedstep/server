# WHAT HAS TO BE TRUE OF THE WHOLE WORLD AFTER A WALK, whatever the walk was.
#
# These are not per-step expectations and no script asks for them: they run
# after every script, against the world it just walked, compared with the file
# it was loaded from. Four of them are the statements the engine defects of
# 2026-09-03 violated, written down as facts about the records rather than as
# facts about one turn -- because that is the shape they had. Nobody typed a
# line that said "give the closet a second door"; a room was realized and the
# closet had two doors afterwards. The fifth, `cast_unmoved`, is the same
# statement about people, added with the whereabouts record: nothing a player
# types may move anybody, and now that presence is a record there is finally
# something to assert it against.
#
#   doors_unchanged      no edge was opened or closed by walking. `Do not open a
#                        new door into a room that is already written` (53e7fbf)
#                        was exactly this: walking into The Long Hallway gave
#                        The Supply Closet a second way out, after the closet's
#                        own prose had said it had none.
#   exit_cap             no room leads more ways out than
#                        `Location::ExitsSchema::MAX_EXITS`. `Make the exit cap
#                        a cap on the room, not on one answer` (9c55969) was a
#                        room that came back with five.
#   items_accounted      every item is in one place -- held by somebody or lying
#                        somewhere, never both -- one of the world's own rows is
#                        never in neither, and the world still has the same
#                        items it started with. `take` and `drop` move a row,
#                        and a row that moved to nowhere is how an item
#                        disappears from a game. Since the captain's ruling of
#                        2026-09-04 "neither" is a place for a playthrough's own
#                        copy -- the party's hands -- so that half is asked of
#                        the world layer alone.
#   world_items_unmoved  every one of THE WORLD'S OWN rows is lying in the room
#                        the file lays it in, AND IN THE CORNER OF IT THE FILE
#                        LAYS IT IN. A typed line may carry one game's copy of
#                        the ward stamp anywhere it likes; it may not touch the
#                        row the next game copies from. This is the item half of
#                        `cast_unmoved`, and before the ruling it could not have
#                        been written at all: `take` moved the world's only row,
#                        so walking into a room and picking something up emptied
#                        it for everybody.
#                        THE CELL IS HELD ON THE SAME TERMS AS THE ROOM, which
#                        is `geometry_unmoved`'s sentence one containment level
#                        down: `items[].x` / `.y` is a value a person wrote in a
#                        file, so a walk that re-rolled a template's corner in
#                        place -- same room, same name, same layer -- would
#                        otherwise pass every instrument here, and
#                        `positions_in_bounds` would clear it for every cell of
#                        the room but one. Both ways, so a template that
#                        ACQUIRED a cell fails as loudly as one that lost it,
#                        and a file that lays nothing in a corner still passes,
#                        which is every row of all three checked-in worlds.
#                        ONE GAME'S OWN COPY IS NOT IN IT and must not be: a
#                        walk is SUPPOSED to move that cell, which is why
#                        `positions_in_bounds` is the instrument for the
#                        playthrough layer and is the one sentence here not
#                        stated against the file.
#   quest_unmoved        the story's ARC is exactly what the world file says --
#                        its beats, what each is bound to, and its endings.
#                        `stat_blocks_unmoved`'s statement one table over: a
#                        quest is written by a seed file and by
#                        `Quest::Generator`, and no typed line may write one.
#                        What a walk IS supposed to move is
#                        `playthrough_beats`, which is this game's progress
#                        through the arc rather than the arc -- the `Item` layer
#                        split applied to plot, and the reason the two are
#                        different tables.
#   cast_unmoved         every character is standing exactly where the world
#                        file put them -- in which room and in which corner of
#                        it -- and anybody the file left nowhere is still
#                        nowhere. `characters.location_id` is the closed
#                        set `talk` resolves against, and NOTHING in a walk may
#                        write it: the seed file, `Character::Registry` (at
#                        realization, which this mode cannot reach) and an
#                        explicit `Character#move_to!` are the only writers, so
#                        a walk that moved somebody means a typed line has
#                        started moving people. `characters.x` / `.y` has the
#                        same writers and is held on the same terms, for
#                        `world_items_unmoved`'s reason: there is no per-game
#                        copy of a person (see `Character#position`), so a cell
#                        that moved during a walk moved for every player at
#                        once. It is stated as "unmoved"
#                        rather than as "nobody is nowhere" because nowhere is
#                        a legitimate state that two of the three checked-in
#                        worlds are in: the protagonist and any companion carry
#                        no whereabouts at all (the party is wherever the
#                        PLAYTHROUGH is), and `The Unrecorded Hour` leaves
#                        Perrin Lasco nowhere on purpose. Comparing against the
#                        file catches everything "nobody is nowhere" would --
#                        somebody who LOST their room during the walk fails it
#                        -- and does not fail on a world that means it.
#   stat_blocks_unmoved  every character's `level`, `hit_die` and three
#                        abilities are what the world file says they are, and
#                        somebody the file gives no `stats` still has none.
#                        All five columns since the captain's ruling of
#                        2026-09-04 evening -- an ability is the world's on
#                        exactly the same terms as a hit die, and `check
#                        strength` throws a die and writes nothing at all.
#                        It is `cast_unmoved` for the
#                        body instead of the whereabouts, and it is the world
#                        half of the captain's ruling of 2026-09-04: a stat
#                        block is the WORLD's, so no typed line may write one.
#                        What a walk does write is `playthrough_vitals` -- how
#                        much is left of somebody in ONE game -- and that is a
#                        different table on the other side of the layer split,
#                        so `harm 5` walks all the way through the engine
#                        without this moving. Stated as "unmoved" rather than as
#                        "everybody has one" for the same reason `cast_unmoved`
#                        is: a file that gives nobody a stat block is a
#                        legitimate world, and comparing against the file
#                        catches everything the stronger sentence would.
#                        WHAT IS NOT IN IT is `characters.hostile`, and the
#                        reason is in `hostility_unmoved` below: that is the
#                        same sentence about the same layer, and it has to cover
#                        `races.monstrous` and `locations.danger` too, neither
#                        of which is a column on a character.
#   hostility_unmoved    the WORLD's four columns about what a room is born with
#                        are what the world file says they are:
#                        `characters.hostile` for every person,
#                        `races.monstrous` for every race, and
#                        `locations.danger` and `locations.population` for every
#                        room -- the last of those since the captain's ruling of
#                        2026-09-07 gave the narrator the pick of how populated a
#                        place is (`Location::Population`), which is a fact about
#                        the world on exactly `danger`'s terms. It is
#                        `stat_blocks_unmoved`'s statement one column over --
#                        no typed line may make somebody hostile, mark a race
#                        monstrous or make a room dangerous -- and it is a
#                        SEPARATE check rather than three more keys on that one
#                        because two of the three are not columns on a character
#                        at all, and an invariant that reported a moved race
#                        under the heading "stat blocks" would send a reader to
#                        the wrong table. The writers are the seed file, the
#                        derivation at creation (`Character.hostile_by_default?`,
#                        which an offline walk cannot reach because it realizes
#                        no rooms), the roll a room is born with
#                        (`Location::Danger`) and, for the population word, the
#                        exits call of the room next door. No player is on that
#                        list and a model is on it exactly once, before the room
#                        exists. Stated as "unmoved" against the file, for
#                        `cast_unmoved`'s reason: a world with no monsters at
#                        all is the ordinary world and comparing against the
#                        file catches everything a stronger sentence would.
#   geometry_unmoved     every location's box -- `Location::Box::COLUMNS` and the
#                        `parent_location` those five numbers are read in -- is
#                        what the world file says it is, and a room the file
#                        gives no box still has none. It is
#                        `stat_blocks_unmoved`'s statement about a place instead
#                        of a body, and it is the standing constraint applied to
#                        geometry: the ENGINE owns every one of those numbers.
#                        The writers are a seed file and, from slice 2, the
#                        interior layout generator; no model and no typed line is
#                        on that list, and nothing in the play path so much as
#                        reads a coordinate today. THE PARENT IS IN IT because it
#                        is the frame -- coordinates are local to a parent and
#                        there is no global space (`Location::Box`), so a walk
#                        that re-parented a room would move it without changing a
#                        number, and an invariant over the five columns alone
#                        would not notice. Stated as "unmoved" against the file
#                        for `cast_unmoved`'s reason: a world with no interiors
#                        at all is the ordinary world -- it is what all three
#                        checked-in worlds are, by the captain's fourth ruling of
#                        2026-09-06 -- and comparing against the file catches
#                        everything a stronger sentence would.
#   positions_in_bounds  every row that says WHERE IN A ROOM it is is inside that
#                        room's box. Items in both layers and characters alike:
#                        the world's own chair, this game's copy of it, and the
#                        clerk standing beside both. It is the ONE invariant
#                        here that is not stated
#                        against the file, and it is not because it cannot be --
#                        a walk is SUPPOSED to move a position. A take clears
#                        one and a drop rolls a new one
#                        (`Playthrough::Turn#carry!` / `#put_down!`), so "unmoved"
#                        would fail on the ordinary case; what a player may
#                        never do is put a thing somewhere its room is not, and
#                        that is a statement about the rows on their own. It
#                        covers three faults in one sentence: a position outside
#                        its box, a position in a room with no box at all (there
#                        is no plane to read it in), and half a position -- and
#                        the last two are only reachable through raw SQL, since
#                        `Item` and `Character` refuse them, so what this
#                        actually watches is the drop. `Story::Doctor` reports
#                        the same three on a stored world; this asserts them
#                        after a walk.
#                        WHAT A SCRIPT OWES IT, because this one is easier to
#                        pass vacuously than the others: every invariant here is
#                        read ONCE, over the records the walk leaves behind
#                        (`EngineSweep::Walk`), and a position exists only while
#                        the thing is on a floor. So a script whose last line
#                        picks everything up leaves nothing for this to be true
#                        OF and passes whatever a drop wrote.
#                        `things-land-somewhere-in-a-room.yml` ends with a drop
#                        for exactly that reason and says so.
#                        AND THE OTHER HALF OF THAT, SAID PLAINLY: an UNPLACED
#                        row is invisible here. `Item.positioned` and
#                        `Character.positioned` take a row carrying either
#                        column, so a `#put_down!` that wrote NEITHER leaves
#                        nothing to check -- `#carry!` has already cleared the
#                        pair, so the row simply drops out of the scope. This
#                        invariant asserts that a position is in the right room,
#                        never that there is one; `Playthrough::TurnPositionTest`
#                        is what asserts a drop writes one at all.
#                        A SCRIPT ALSO OWES IT A CELL THE WRONG ROOM CANNOT
#                        HOLD. Two rooms one above the other can share a cell --
#                        `Location::Box#contains?` ignores `z` by design -- so a
#                        stale position carried from one to the other is in
#                        bounds for both and passes. `the-quay-house.yml` lays
#                        the seal ledger at an x the room above does not run to,
#                        and its header has the arithmetic.
#   room_names_unique    no two rooms of one place answer to one name, on
#                        `WorldSeed.natural_key`'s reading of "one name". The
#                        one name in the app a MODEL chooses for a row the
#                        engine then looks up by name -- `Location::RoomName`
#                        writes it at realization -- so this is the offline
#                        assertion that whatever it wrote left the building's
#                        rooms tellable apart.
#   place_names_unique   no two locations of the STORY answer to one name, on
#                        the same reading -- the gap the check above leaves
#                        open on purpose. A duplicate written at the OUTERMOST
#                        level is `placed?` nowhere and so is invisible to it;
#                        the captain's Call 7 of 2026-09-08 is a whole exits
#                        answer that got through that way. It has no teeth on
#                        the generator (an offline walk never realizes) and
#                        real teeth on every re-seed script, where
#                        `WorldSeed::Loader` writes rows against a played
#                        world.
#   desires_unmoved      what every character WANTS is what the world file says
#                        they want -- the four sentences and the two pursuit
#                        labels, and somebody the file leaves without them
#                        still has none. `stat_blocks_unmoved`'s statement one
#                        set of columns over, and on exactly its layer: the
#                        four objects of desire are world data written by a
#                        seed file and by the two generators, and no typed line
#                        may write one. What a walk IS supposed to write is
#                        `playthrough_volitions`, which is what somebody DID
#                        about what they want -- a different table on the other
#                        side of the layer split, so a whole game of people
#                        walking out of rooms leaves this unmoved.
#                        IT IS SEPARATE FROM `hostility_unmoved` even though
#                        both are world columns on a character, for that
#                        check's own stated reason: two of `hostility_unmoved`'s
#                        four are not columns on a character at all, and a
#                        reader sent to the wrong table by a heading is the
#                        thing these separations exist to prevent.
#   volitions_moved_what_they_named
#                        every act somebody took on their own moved the row
#                        their token NAMED, and nothing else. A `move:412` row
#                        means that person is in location 412 (the exit token
#                        names the destination room's id) and not in the room
#                        they left; a `take:77` row means item 77 is in their
#                        hands; a `give:` row means it is in the player's. It is
#                        the one invariant here stated against the RECEIPTS
#                        rather than against the file, and it has to be: a walk
#                        is SUPPOSED to move these rows, so "unmoved" would fail
#                        on the ordinary case. What it watches is the gap
#                        between what a receipt says happened and what the
#                        records say -- `Playthrough::Volition` writes the row
#                        and the effect in one transaction, and this is the
#                        assertion that they stayed one thing.
#                        A REJECTED ROW AND A `wait` ARE IN IT TOO, and they are
#                        the cheaper half: both claim to have moved nothing, so
#                        both are checked by naming no row at all.
#                        ONLY THE LAST CLAIM THAT STILL MATTERS IS ASKED ABOUT.
#                        A person can walk to room A and later to room B; the
#                        earlier `move:A` receipt is historically true and no
#                        longer a claim about the world the walk left behind, so
#                        only their latest applied move is checked. The same for
#                        a take that a later give of the same item superseded,
#                        and for a move that a later `follow` superseded: from
#                        then on they go where the player goes.
#                        WHAT SOMEBODY SAID UNASKED IS IN IT TOO (a `speak:`
#                        row, the engine's speech die), and it names a record
#                        without moving one: `speak:ask:77` names item 77 and
#                        `speak:warn:way:412` the room that doorway leads to.
#                        Such a row is checked by the record it names being a
#                        row of this story's, applied or rejected, and it is
#                        never a token that moves a row.
#   speech_moved_nothing what somebody asked for or demanded unasked is in
#                        their hands only where a receipt that MOVES things put
#                        it there -- a `take:` of theirs, or an offer of the
#                        player's they accepted. A speech row's fact says
#                        "Nothing changed hands", and this is the assertion
#                        that the records agree: the engine never hands a thing
#                        over because somebody asked for it.
#   nothing_was_written  no room changed detail level. This is the offline
#                        mode's own premise: with no model there is nothing to
#                        write a room WITH, so a stub walked into stays a stub.
#                        Since `Item::Registry` it carries a second guarantee
#                        for free -- a room furnishes itself at the moment it is
#                        realized, so a world in which nothing was written is a
#                        world in which nothing was furnished either. If this
#                        one ever fails, the sweep's assumptions have changed
#                        and the scripts need re-reading before anything else is
#                        believed.
#
# WHY THERE IS NO ITEM CAP HERE, beside `exit_cap`, though `Item::Registry` has
# two of them. `MAX_EXITS` bounds a room: nothing but the generator opens a
# door, so more than four ways out is wrong however it happened.
# `Item::Registry::MAX_PER_ROOM` and `MAX_PER_STORY` bound GENERATION -- they
# are read to decide whether to admit another candidate -- and a player may
# legitimately walk into a room carrying four things and put them all down. An
# invariant on the floor's size would flag that walk as a defect. The caps
# belong to the registry's own tests and to `rake game:doctor`, which diagnoses
# a stored world; this file only asserts what a walk did to a fresh one.
#
# WHAT THEY COST WHEN THEY HOLD, which is what they do today: nothing. A move
# offline writes no exits, so `doors_unchanged` is a statement the offline
# engine cannot currently break on its own. That is not a reason to leave it
# out. It is the assertion the defect broke, it costs four queries, and it fires
# the moment anything in a walk starts writing edges -- which is precisely the
# change that would need watching.

  # not see it, `#doors_unchanged` reported the extra door and not the extra
  # place, and the defect reached the captain's database through the one shape
  # nothing here asserted on.
  #
  # AND IT IS HONEST ABOUT WHAT A SWEEP CAN REACH. An offline walk never
  # realizes a room, so no script can drive `#connect_exit!` and this check
  # cannot fire on the generator's own path -- the unit tests in
  # `test/models/location/generator_test.rb` are what pin that. What it DOES

  # against a played world, and writing a second row beside a renamed one is
  # the original shape of this defect (`WorldSeed.natural_key`'s header).

  # game's progress and is SUPPOSED to move. If a walk ever changed what the arc

  #   WHAT EACH ONE IS BOUND TO, by the name of the row rather than by its id,
