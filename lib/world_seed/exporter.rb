# Dumps a generated world to a checked-in seed file.
#
# The whole graph goes out: the Universe and its races, the Story, its
# characters (and their items), every Location the story has -- realized or
# stub -- the edges between them, and the story's own `mechanics`. What is
# deliberately left behind is progress rather than world: Playthroughs,
# `last_protagonist_visit`, the `WorldEvent` LOG, a mechanic's `last_run_at` and
# every Scene BUT ONE are somebody's way through the world, not the world.
# #warnings says so out loud when there is any, so nothing is dropped silently.
#
# THE ONE KIND OF `WorldEvent` THAT DOES CROSS THAT LINE is an unfired row a
# world FILE scheduled -- *the tide is over the low door in three quarters of an
# hour* is a rule this world was written with rather than a thing that has
# happened to it. See `#schedule_document`.
#
# THE ONE SCENE THAT CROSSES THAT LINE is the story's opening arrival, and it
# is worth saying why, because the line is otherwise a good one. Every other
# scene is a record of somebody having been somewhere: it exists because a
# player walked in, it belongs to their linked list, and seeding it into a fresh
# database would be seeding a playthrough. The opening arrival is not that. No
# player made it happen -- it is the moment the story begins, the same for
# everyone who ever plays it, and it is the answer to a question the world is
# supposed to know: what does it read like to be standing here at the start.
# Leaving it out meant the one arrival in the game nobody narrates, and a talk
# branch that could not be reached in a seeded world because no scene recorded
# anybody standing in the opening room.
#
# A Scene has no natural key, so `scenes.is_opening` is the marker and the
# loader's key both: exactly one per story, enforced by Scene's own validation.
#
# Connections are stored as two directional rows per edge, both carrying the
# same values -- LocationConnection's enums are direction-neutral precisely so
# that holds. The file therefore lists each edge ONCE, as an unordered
# `between: [a, b]` pair, and the loader writes both rows back. A file that
# listed both directions would double the hand-editing and could be edited into
# an asymmetric state the model does not support. If the database ever holds
# only one direction of an edge, that is reported in #warnings and the reverse
# row is created the next time the file is loaded.
