# Loads a checked-in world into the database. Offline and idempotent: no model
# call, no API key, no network, and running it twice leaves exactly what running
# it once left.
#
# Idempotency is on natural keys, never on `id` -- ids differ on every load:
#
#   Story      title                     (the file's identity; keep them unique)
#   Universe   the story's universe      (the table has no natural key of its own)
#   Race       (universe, name)          unique index; `monstrous` is written on
#                                        every load, in both directions
#   Character  (story, fullname)         unique index; `stats` is the file's own
#                                        answer for a body, re-asserted like a
#                                        placement and left alone when absent.
#                                        `hostile` is written on every load, in
#                                        both directions, like `absent`
#   Location   (story, name), then the    case-insensitively first, matching
#              place and the box          Location::Generator#find_location; then
#                                        on WorldSeed.natural_key, which
#                                        recognizes a room the FILE renamed; then
#                                        on the place and the box a file draws a
#                                        room in, which recognizes one the ENGINE
#                                        renamed -- and only for a row this file
#                                        names nowhere else.
#                                        WorldSeed.find_location owns all three.
#                                        `danger` is written on every load,
#                                        in both directions, and an absent key is
#                                        Location::SAFE
#   Connection (location, connected)     unique index, written both ways -- and
#                                        a mobile room's doorway is matched on
#                                        ARITY as well, because the world's own
#                                        mechanic moves the far end of it
#   Item       (story, name)             NOT (owner, name): an item moves, and a
#                                        world that has been played has items
#                                        somewhere other than where the file
#                                        puts them. Keying on the owner would
#                                        re-seed a dropped daybook as a second
#                                        daybook; keying on the story finds the
#                                        one that exists and puts it back. On
#                                        WorldSeed.natural_key after that, for
#                                        the same reason a location is. `bulk`
#                                        is written on every load, in both
#                                        directions, and an absent key is
#                                        Item::HANDY; `fragility` likewise, and
#                                        an absent key is Item::STURDY. A
#                                        FIXTURE (`holds:`) and a row a kit
#                                        wrote (`kit_key:`) are matched in
#                                        their own ROOM instead: a fixture
#                                        never moves and a kit's names repeat
#                                        from room to room by design, so every
#                                        study may have its desk
#   Scene      (story, is_opening)       the story's one opening arrival, which
#                                        is the only Scene that is world rather
#                                        than progress -- see WorldSeed::Exporter
#   Mechanic   (story, name)             unique index; a world's own laws are
#                                        world data, so they are seeded with it
#   Quest      (story, title)            unique index; a world's own ARC is
#                                        world data on exactly the terms its
#                                        laws are. Its steps key on (quest,
#                                        position) and its outcomes on (quest,
#                                        name), and the whole block is
#                                        RE-ASSERTED -- a step the file drops is
#                                        deleted, because an arc is a shape
#                                        rather than an accumulation. What is
#                                        NOT re-asserted is any playthrough's
#                                        beats: those are progress
#   WorldEvent (story, source, summary)  ONLY the `schedule:` block -- a row
#                                        saying a thing WILL happen, which is
#                                        world data. The LOG of what already
#                                        did is not, is never exported, and is
#                                        never touched here. An unfired
#                                        seeded row the file has dropped is
#                                        deleted; a FIRED one stays, because
#                                        that one is history
#
# RE-SEEDING A WORLD SOMEBODY HAS PLAYED, which is what this file's rules are
# actually about. The captain re-seeds his long-lived development database to
# pick up a file change and then keeps playing the same stories for days, so
# "add and never look" is not a tidiness problem here: it is how one world came
# to hold two supply closets with the office opening onto both, and how a
# nightly connection shuffle came to be re-asserted as a SECOND doorway off
# every mobile lane.
#
# THE RULE IS: RECONCILE WHAT THE FILE CAN PROVE, SAY OUT LOUD WHAT IT CANNOT,
# AND DELETE NOTHING. Three reconciliations, and each one is a fact the file
# already carries rather than a guess:
#
#   A RENAMED ROW IS THE SAME ROW. Identity is `WorldSeed.natural_key`, one
#   step wider than the written name -- case, whitespace and a leading article
#   are not part of it -- so editing "Supply Closet" to "The Supply Closet"
#   renames the row that exists instead of creating a second one beside it.
#   Locations and items both; the file's spelling wins, which is the same
#   "the file re-asserts itself" rule the placements follow.
#
#   AND A ROOM OF A PLACE IS THE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME COORDINATES, whatever it
#   has come to be called -- BUT ONLY WHERE THIS DOCUMENT NAMES NO OTHER ROOM
#   THAT ROW COULD BE. That is the half of the rule above the written name
#   cannot reach: `Location::RoomName` names a room of a laid-out place when
#   somebody first walks into it, so a stub the file declares as
#   `The Custom House room 1` can be a row called `the counting room` by the
#   time the file is loaded over it again -- a rename nothing about the two
#   strings could recognize, and the row's name appears nowhere in the file.
#   A row the file DOES name is that declaration's, and the coordinates have
#   nothing to add: without that limit, which of two declarations got the played
#   row came down to which of them the document happened to list first.
#   `WorldSeed.find_location` has the argument in full.
#
#   AND THE FILE'S SPELLING WINS EXCEPT OVER A NUMBER. The one exception to the
#   two rules above, and the only place in this file where the document does not
#   get the last word: a placeholder is PROVISIONAL, so a file still carrying
#   `The Custom House room 1` for a row somebody has named is not asserting a
#   name and does not overwrite one. `WorldSeed.keeps_its_own_name?` carries
#   what putting the number back would cost -- a room realized under its number
#   is never offered a name again.
#
#   A DOORWAY THE WORLD'S OWN MECHANIC MOVED HAS NOT GONE MISSING.
#   `WorldMechanic::ShuffleConnections` repoints the anchored end of every
#   mobile <-> anchored edge and preserves each room's degree, so a file edge
#   whose pair is no longer on record is USUALLY not a missing doorway but a
#   moved one. Where the mobile end already carries every doorway the file
#   gives it, the file's pair is left unwritten and said so. Which anchored
#   place a mobile room has come to rest against is progress, like
#   `last_run_at` and `last_protagonist_visit`, and the file deliberately
#   carries none of those.
#
#   WHAT IT CANNOT PROVE IS A RENAME NO NORMALIZED NAME RECOGNIZES OF A ROOM
#   WITH NO BOX -- "The Supply Closet" edited to "The Broom Cupboard" is, to
#   any loader, a room that does not exist yet. (A room of a place is the box
#   rule above, whoever wrote the two names.) Nothing in the file says which room it replaced,
#   and merging two rooms on a guess would destroy play rather than duplicate
#   it. So the loader creates the new row, and WARNS: `#warnings` names every
#   location and item a re-seed created in a story that has been played, and
#   points at `rake game:doctor`, which reports the pair it can recognize
#   (`duplicate_locations`, `duplicate_items`,
#   `mobile_location_over_its_seeded_arity`) with a safe repair.
#
# It still adds and updates and never deletes: a row play created is never
# touched. `rake game:delete` plus `bin/rails db:seed` is the clean rebuild.
#
# AND SINCE THE CAPTAIN'S RULING OF 2026-09-04, "a row play created" is a whole
# LAYER rather than a judgement call. Every playthrough holds its own copy of
# the world's things (`Item::Snapshot`), and this loader writes the world layer
# and only the world layer -- `Item.templates` in `#find_item` and
# `#find_renamed_item`, `playthrough: nil, template: nil` on every row it saves.
# So re-asserting the file can no longer take a thing out of somebody's hands
# mid-game: it puts the world's own row back and leaves every game alone.

      # file no longer marks would keep the world writing monsters into a room
      # its author had made safe, and there would be no way to undo it from the
      # file. An absent key is `Location::SAFE`, which is the column's default
      # and what every room already written is.
      # AND HOW POPULATED THE FILE SAYS IT IS, written in both directions on
      # every load for `danger`'s reason one key up: a stale `a crowd` left on a
      # row the file no longer marks would go on writing people into a room its
      # author had emptied, with no way to undo it from the file. An absent key
      # is NIL AND NOT `nobody`, and the two are different -- nil is *nobody
      # picked a word*, which is the state the engine rolls one for, and
      # `nobody` is a file saying this place is empty. `Location::Population`'s
      # header has both, and the reason a seeded room usually notices neither:
      # the label is read when a room is REALIZED, and a seeded room that
      # carries a description was realized by its author.
      # AND WHAT THE PLACE DOES TO SOMEBODY STANDING IN IT, written in both
      # directions on every load for `danger`'s reason one key over: a stale
      # `flooded` left on a row the file no longer marks would go on costing
      # players hit points in a room its author had made safe, with no way to
      # undo it from the file. An absent key is NO HAZARD, which is what every
      # room already written is and what the nullable column says.
      # AND WHERE IN ITS PARENT IT SITS, IF THE FILE LAYS ONE OUT. Written in
      # both directions on every load for `danger`'s reason two keys up: a
      # stale box left on a row the file no longer lays out would go on putting
      # a room somewhere its author had taken it out of, with no way to undo it
      # from the file. An absent set of keys is NO INTERIOR, which is what every
      # room in every checked-in world is (the captain's fourth ruling of
      # 2026-09-06) and what the five nullable columns say.
      #
      # `parent` IS EXCLUDED because it is a name and not a column: containment

  #
  # MATCHED ON `WorldSeed.natural_key`, which is the key every other cross
  # reference in this file resolves on, so "the Rusted Anchor" and "Rusted

  # A world's cast is world data exactly as its items are, so the file is the
  # writer: `Character.present_in` is the closed set `talk` resolves against,
  # and until it had a source a seeded world's people existed nowhere and could
  # only be spoken to in whichever room the opening arrival's cast happened to
  # name. The Salt Assizes is the case that named it -- its premise is Neb
  # Halloran chained to the tide post, and nothing recorded him there.
  #
  # THE KEY IS OPTIONAL AND AN ABSENT ONE MEANS NOWHERE, which is a real state
  # and is left alone rather than guessed at: `rake game:doctor` reports a
  # seeded character the file did not place.
  #
  # `absent: true` IS THE FILE SAYING IT MEANT THAT. A missing key still means
  # "nobody has said where they are" and is still reported; the marker says
  # "nowhere, and that is the story", which is what `The Unrecorded Hour` has
  # always meant about Perrin Lasco. It writes `characters.deliberately_absent`
  # and `#validate!` refuses the pair with a `location`, because a file cannot
  # mean both. Written on every load in both directions -- `absent: true` sets
  # it, an absent key clears it -- so deleting the marker from the file and
  # re-seeding takes it off the record, exactly as the placements, the
  # connections and the items re-assert themselves over a played world.
  #
  # It is written straight rather than
  # through `Character::Registry` for the same reason the items above it are
  # written straight -- a seed file IS the decision, so the registry's "do not
  # move somebody who is already somewhere" rule would make re-seeding unable
  # to put a played world's cast back where the file says they belong. That is

  # of them against its own tables, so a hit die of 7 or a strength of 19 is
  # refused rather than loaded.
  #
  # AN ABSENT KEY IS NOT A ROLL. A file that says nothing about a body leaves
  # all five columns exactly as they are -- which for a fresh row is nil, a
  # state `rake game:doctor` reports and `rake game:backfill_stat_blocks` fills
  # in. It is deliberately NOT rolled here, for the reason every other absent
  # key in this loader is left alone: a re-seed must not quietly rewrite a world
  # every time somebody edits a different part of the file, and a hand-authored
  # world that wants a particular body says so.
  #
  # THE FILE RE-ASSERTS ITSELF over a played world when the key IS there,
  # exactly as the placements and the items do. Lowering somebody's hit die
  # under a game in progress is legitimate and leaves that game's condition row
  # above its new maximum, which `rake game:doctor` reports
  # (`hp_above_maximum`) with a safe repair. Editing an ability disturbs nothing
  # at all: no playthrough row is derived from one, because `Character#max_hp`
  # has no ability term in it.

  # for something lying in a room, and the other half is written nil so that
  # re-seeding cannot leave an item in two places at once.
  #
  # IT WRITES THE WORLD LAYER AND NEVER AN INSTANCE, and since the captain's
  # ruling of 2026-09-04 that is the whole of what "the file re-asserts itself
  # over a played world" now means. A seed file describes a WORLD: what a room
  # was built holding, what a person was written carrying. Every playthrough
  # takes its own copy of that at first contact (`Item::Snapshot`), and those
  # copies are the games in progress -- so a re-seed that reached into them
  # would take a thing out of somebody's hands mid-game to put it back on a
  # shelf that already has one. `playthrough: nil` and `template: nil` are
  # written on every leg to say it in the row.
  #
  # WHAT THAT COSTS, stated: an already-copied instance keeps the description
  # the file gave it when the party first walked in, so editing a room's item
  # text reaches every game that has not been there yet and no game that has.
  # That is inherent in copying and it is the right way round -- the alternative
  # is a file edit rewriting what a player is holding.
  #
  # A PROTAGONIST'S ITEMS ARE THE STORY'S STARTING INVENTORY. They stay held by
  # the protagonist row, in the world layer, and every playthrough of the world
  # begins with a COPY of each in the PARTY'S own hands --
  # `Story#starting_inventory` and `Item::Snapshot#of_the_party!` have the
  # argument. So the file keeps writing exactly what it wrote before and the
  # meaning of the row is what changed: world data rather than one shared pair
  # of hands.
  #
  # Items under a LOCATION are what a HAND-WRITTEN world carries so that
  # anything in it is takeable. A generated room furnishes itself now
  # (`Item::Registry`, written at realization), so this is no longer the only
  # way a thing gets onto a floor -- but a seeded room is realized by the file
  # rather than by a model call, so what is lying in one is whatever the file
  # says and nothing else. The registry leaves seeded rooms alone.
  #
  # MATCHED ON (story, name), NOT ON THE OWNER, because a template can still
  # move: `rake game:backfill_items` puts one back where a pre-layer take
  # carried it off from, and a hand-edited database can put one anywhere.
  # Keying on the owner would look for the daybook in the hands the file puts it
  # in, not find it, and seed a second one. Keying on the story finds the one
  # that exists and puts it back where the file says it belongs -- the same rule
  # the connections already follow.
  #
  # A FIXTURE AND WHAT LIES ON IT. `holds:` makes a row a fixture -- `Item`'s
  # header -- fixed in place and `immovable` whatever else the file says, and
  # `within:` names the fixture in the same room a thing lies on or in, with
  # `how` read off what that fixture holds (in a `hollow` one, on anything
  # else). Fixtures are written first so a thing can name one. Both are written
  # in both directions on every load, `bulk`'s rule: a row the file no longer

  # about -- somebody moved them. An arc has no such rows: a step is a
  # statement the file makes, and a step the file has stopped making is not a
  # beat somebody walked, it is a plot point the author took out. Leaving it
  # would give a re-seeded world an arc nobody can finish, which is exactly the
  # defect this whole slice exists to prevent. What a PLAYER did -- their beats
  # and their ending -- is `playthrough_beats` and `playthrough_endings`, is
  # never in the file, and is never touched here.
  #
  # AND BINDING IS THE SAME SIDE EFFECT IT IS EVERYWHERE ELSE. A step names a
  # place, a person or a thing and this looks it up in the story that was just
  # loaded, through `Quest::Binder` -- the one statement of what a step will
  # take, so a seeded arc and a generated one bind under one rule. A file may

  # with no `parent` reads against nothing at all, and two rooms in the same
  # place at once load without complaint and are only ever noticed by somebody
  # drawing the map.
  #
  # `Location::Box` owns what a whole shape IS -- an extent alone is a
  # FOOTPRINT, the plane a place's children are read in; all five is a BOX, a
  # room placed on a storey of its parent; anything else is partial. What is
  # here is the six rules a FILE is held to on top of that:
  #
  #   whole      one of `Location::Box.shape`'s three whole answers. `Location`
  #              refuses a partial one too, so a file with one never loads
  #              either way; this names the file and the room.
  #   integers   whole numbers, with a positive width and depth. A room zero
  #              paces across is a room nothing can stand in.
  #   framed     a BOX needs a `parent`, because coordinates are local to a
  #              parent and there is no global space. A footprint does not, and
  #              must not be made to: something has to sit at the top of the
  #              containment tree.
  #   footprint  and that parent needs an extent of its own, or the plane the
  #              child's position is read in does not exist.
  #   declared   `parent` names one of this file's own locations, and not
  #              itself, and not a cycle -- a room cannot be inside a place that
  #              is inside it.
  #   apart      no two boxes under one parent on one storey overlap. Across
  #              storeys is not an overlap at all: 2.5D, so each floor is its
  #              own plane (the captain's third ruling of 2026-09-06).
  #
  # `rake game:doctor` reports these faults on a database that already carries
  # them -- all but the half of `declared` that is a question about a file and
  # not about a row, that a `parent` names a location THIS FILE declares -- which
  # is what makes a world written before any of this diagnosable rather than

  #              character with no `location` is nowhere and has none.
