# A REALIZATION BENCH RUN'S NUMBERS, PERSISTED, so a later prompt change can be
# judged against them.
#
# The same convention as `Eval::Prompt::Result` and beside it in the same
# directory: one file per set, written by the run and read by
# `rake eval:realization_compare` and `rake eval:realization_board`. Its own
# file -- `realization.json` -- because a set can legitimately hold a prose run,
# a classifier bench, a prompt bench and this, and four files of one name
# cannot.
#
# WHAT IS KEPT IS EVERY READING: both answers, the facts they were asked
# against, what the registries admitted, the prompts, the tokens and the
# latency. The rates are recomputed from them on load, so a change to how a
# check reads does not need the calls paid for again -- the rule `Eval::RunSet`
# follows by keeping the run databases and `Eval::Prompt::Result` by keeping
# every passage.
#
# AND A KEPT SET IS A SUMMARY, which is the form that gets checked in. See
# `#summary` for what it gives up and what it keeps.

  # THE FIGURES WITH NO BETTER DIRECTION, printed with a verdict and no arrow.
  # `Eval::Realization::Scorer`'s header is the argument, and it is
  # `Eval::Richness`'s applied to rooms: the cheapest way to clear every rate is
  # to write one exit and nobody, so a prompt change that improved every rate
  # and halved these bought its numbers with emptier rooms. Folding them in --
  # in either direction -- is exactly the mistake they exist to catch.
