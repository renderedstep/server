# THE CORPUS, REALIZED THROUGH THE REAL GENERATOR, TWO CALLS A CASE.
#
# `Location::Generator#realize!` runs whole, on a staged stub, with NOTHING
# replaced. That is the difference between this and the other two benches and it
# is worth stating plainly: the prompt bench has to stand in for the classifier
# (a second model between the case and the passage would make a case take a
# branch its facts were not written for), and the classifier bench asks one call
# in isolation. A realization has no such seam and needs none -- the two calls
# ARE the thing being measured, in the order and the conversation the app makes
# them in, so the app is simply run.
#
# WHAT IS READ AFTERWARDS IS THE APP'S OWN ACCOUNT OF THE CALL. The prompts, the
# instruction block, the raw JSON that came back, the tokens: all of it off the
# `chats` and `messages` rows `BaseAgent` wrote, exactly as
# `Playthrough::Feedback#provenance_for` and `Eval::Prompt::Bench#receipts_for`
# read them. Nothing here rebuilds a prompt to record it, because a rebuilt
# prompt is a prompt nobody sent.
#
# AND WHAT THE REGISTRIES DID WITH THE ANSWER, off the records: who is standing
# in the room, what is lying in it, and which places came into existence. That
# is the half no reading of the answer could give -- `Item::Registry` and
# `Character::Registry` refuse a proposal for reasons the model was told about
# and reasons it was not, and the difference between what was named and what was
# admitted is a defect with a cost.
#
# ITS OWN COPY OF THE WORLD PER CASE AND PER REPETITION, through
# `Eval::Realization::Stage`. A realization writes rows -- a room, its floor,
# its cast, its neighbours -- so a second repetition standing on the first one's
# world would be realizing a room into a world that already held the answer. The
# stage rolls the whole thing back when the receipts have been read out into
# Ruby.
#
# SEVERAL REPETITIONS, BECAUSE ONE IS NOT A MEASUREMENT. The default is
# `Eval::Noise::MIN_RUNS`, so a run taken at the default is a run a later
# comparison can give a verdict against.
#
# PER MODEL, ONE MODEL PER ARM, NOTHING BEHIND IT -- `Eval::Classifier::Arm`,
# shared rather than copied. Read its header for the three reasons a measurement
# wants the rotation off.
#
# SERIAL, ON PURPOSE, and for a stronger reason than the prompt bench's: this
# one stages a copy of a world PER CASE and then writes into it. Two cases in
# flight are two stagings in flight against one SQLite connection, and the
# isolation each case needs is exactly what makes them impossible to share. The
# latencies below are therefore serial figures -- what one player waits for a
# room, with nothing queued behind it.
#
# AND THE FIRST CALL IS ITS OWN FIGURE. Every arm gets one warm realization
# before its first pass, timed, reported as `first call` and excluded from the
# latencies -- so the figures the board prints are WARM-CACHE FIGURES and say so.
class Eval::Realization::Bench
  # WHAT ONE CASE CAME BACK AS, with the facts it was asked against.
  #
  # `facts` is the world as the RECORDS held it BEFORE the call -- the
  # allowances, the rolled cast slots, the places that already exist and which
  # of them are written, the names already spoken for. It is stored beside the
  # answer so `Eval::Realization::Scorer` can be run again, offline and for
  # nothing, without the calls being paid for a second time.
  #
  # `answers` is the provider's own JSON for each of the two calls, by name, and
  # `after` is what the registries made of it.
