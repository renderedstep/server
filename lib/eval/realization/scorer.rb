# WHAT THE MODEL WROTE, AGAINST WHAT THE PROMPT TOLD IT, AND NOTHING ELSE.
#
# NEARLY EVERY CHECK IN HERE IS A SET COMPARISON, and that is the design rather
# than a limitation. The standing constraint (AGENTS.md) is that nothing may
# depend on a model obeying its prompt; the corollary for an instrument is that
# nothing may depend on a CHECKER understanding prose. So each of those reads a
# name the model wrote against a closed list of names the prompt handed it, or a
# count against a number the prompt stated. Both sides are records. A rate there
# is therefore the same kind of fact `rake game:sweep` produces -- something the
# app itself could have asserted -- rather than a reading.
#
# THE EXCEPTIONS ARE `KEYWORD_CHECKS`, AND EACH IS NAMED FOR WHAT IT CAN SEE.
# `race_not_named` can tell that the word "Nocturna-Blighted" is absent from a
# sheet written for a Nocturna-Blighted slot, and it cannot tell a compliant
# person described entirely in chitin and silence from a non-compliant one.
# `size_the_records_do_not_hold` compares numbers, but it has to READ them out
# of prose first. They are reported apart from the checks the records prove,
# with that stated, and their false-positive rate is unknown until a baseline is
# bought -- which is exactly the discipline two earlier prose-reading checks
# failed (`data/ta-model-bench`, and `Story::Scoreboard`'s header). That
# constant is the one list of them; do not count them in a sentence.
#
# OFFLINE, FROM THE STORED ROWS AND NOTHING ELSE. It touches no table, so a set
# can be scored again after the calls are paid for -- the rule `Eval::RunSet`
# follows by keeping the run databases and `Eval::Prompt::Scorer` by keeping the
# facts beside the passage.
#
# THE HAZARD THIS IS BUILT AGAINST, and it is `Eval::Richness`'s exactly: THE
# CHEAPEST WAY TO CLEAR EVERY RATE BELOW IS TO WRITE ONE EXIT AND NOBODY. A room
# that names only the way back cannot restate a place it should not have, cannot
# open a door into a written room and cannot exceed its allowance; a room with
# nobody in it cannot reuse a name or fail to write a monster. That is not an
# edge case, it is the dominant strategy for anything optimising these numbers.
# So `exits_named`, `new_places_opened`, `people_named` and `items_named` are
# printed BESIDE the rates, are never folded into them, and have no better
# direction -- a prompt change that cleared every rate and halved those bought
# its numbers with emptier rooms.
#
# THE PEOPLE HALF OF THAT HAZARD IS NOW THE SCHEMA'S, and it is the clearest
# example in this file of the difference between a rate and a guarantee. Since
# the captain's ruling of 2026-09-07 the count is EXACT -- the narrator picks a
# word, the engine rolls the number, `Location::DetailSchema.for_people`
# requires it -- so a room that answered with nobody where two were asked for is
# a FAILED CALL and not a good score. `people_short_of_the_pick` is the check
# that says whether that holds against a real provider, and
# `population_declined` is the one that says whether the pick was made at all:
# the way for that ruling to come to nothing is not a model answering `nobody`
# but a model answering nothing, which is `inside_declined`'s finding one field
# over.
#
# AND THE DENOMINATOR IS PER CHECK, exactly as `Story::Audit#judgeable_for`
# makes it: `readable_without_words` can only be judged on a case that named
# something readable, and counting every case into it would report a rate the
# check never earned.
#
# ONE FINDING FOR A LATER PROMPT ITEM, RECORDED HERE BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE IT
# WAS FOUND AND NOT ACTED ON: `Location::Generator`'s exits prompt carries two
# sentences that contradict each other on a dead end. The instructions say *"if
# the only way out is back the place the player came from, list that place and
# nothing else"*, and `#already_reachable_note` says the places this room
# already leads to *"do not need naming again"* -- so on a room with one edge
# the prompt asks for the way back and forbids it in the same breath. THIS FILE
# DOES NOT FIX THAT, because this bench measures those prompts and a bench that
# edited its own subject would be measuring itself. What it does instead is
# refuse to score the ambiguity: see `#correct_dead_end?`, which takes a case
# that named only the way back and declared no new ground OUT OF
# `exit_already_reachable`'s denominator rather than flagging it. A prompt item
# that resolves the contradiction should re-baseline and then delete the gate.

  # which rather than filing it as either. What it COMPARES is a record and
  # nothing but: a number out of `Location::Box`, off the very `Location::Plan`
  # the prompt was built from. What it READS is prose --
  # `Story::Audit::Prose.size_claims` and `.storey_claims`, whose grammars are
  # narrow and whose measured detection counts are on those methods. A
  # description that contradicts its own floor plan in a sentence neither
  # grammar reads is a miss, so this is counted here with `race_not_named`
  # rather than beside the set comparisons.
  #
  # AND THE WALLS ARE NOT CHECKED AT ALL. Which wall the prose put a door in was
  # a check here and is now
  # `Eval::Realization::UNAVAILABLE_TO_A_REALIZATION`'s

  # admitted a false-positive shape the one before it did not, and a rate off
  # any of them would have been a clean-looking lie. The PROMPT still states
  # every door's wall; what is gone is the claim to verify it afterwards.
  #
  # AND A CLAIM THAT ECHOES THE PROMPT IS NOT A DEFECT, which is why the
  # denominator is not simply the count of claims a grammar found:

    # WHY THE KEY AND NOT THE METHOD ITSELF, since a delegation would be

    #
    #   IT TAKES A STORY AND QUERIES THE TABLE (`Location.where(story_id:)`),
    #   and this file touches none -- that is the whole of what lets a set in
    #   `db/eval/` be rescored after the run databases are gone and the story's
    #   rows with them. See this class's header.
    #
    #   AND IT WOULD BE ASKING THE WRONG WORLD. `.find_location` searches the
    #   story AS IT STANDS; a check has to ask what the world held when the
    #   PROMPT WAS BUILT, which is `facts["places"]` -- the very list the model
    #   was shown. Resolving against today's rows would score an answer against
    #   places written after it.
    #
    # SO WHAT IS SHARED IS THE RULE AND NOT A COPY OF IT. `.find_location`
    # matches in two legs -- an exact case-insensitive name, then `.natural_key`
    # -- and the first is a SUBSET of the second, because equal downcase implies
    # an equal key. Its third leg (`.find_placed_location`) is unreachable from
    # the generator, which passes no declarations. So the engine's rule for a
    # NAME is `.natural_key` equality exactly, which is what this asks.
    # `test/lib/eval/realization/scorer_test.rb` pins the two together against
    # real rows, so the day one of them widens is a failing test rather than a
    # bench quietly disagreeing with the engine it measures.

  # AND THE TWO THAT READ THE PICK AGAINST A HAND LABEL, which is the only thing
  # in this file that is not a record on both sides -- there is no record of what

  # case and is LEFT OUT unless the answer is not a guess, so most cases are out
  # of both denominators: `Story::Audit#judgeable_for`'s rule, and the same one
  # `no_new_ground` stands on.
  #
  # A PICK THE ENGINE THREW AWAY. `Location::Generator#connect_exit!` passes
  # `inside:` to `.create_stub!` and NOWHERE ELSE, so an exit that resolves to a
  # place the world already holds reuses that row and the pick has no effect on
  # anything: the place is whatever it already was. The answer still SPENT the

  # article variant DID open a second row, and the pick reached the world --
  # badly, as the duplicate defect that fix closed, but it reached it. This
  # check reports what happened rather than what would happen today.

  #
  # AND IT IS THE CEILING HALF OF THE LABEL SINCE THE CAPTAIN'S CALL 6 OF

  # `at most one` is the same arithmetic one rung up. Each of the four words has
  # exactly one of the two bounds (`Lab::Exits::Quantifier`), so exactly one of
  # this pair is judgeable on any one case.
  #
  # THE TWO CHECKS KEEP THEIR NAMES, WHICH ARE THE BOOLEAN ERA'S WORDS FOR THE
  # TWO DIRECTIONS, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight: a check key
  # is what a stored set's figures are filed under, so renaming one would make
  # every kept set read `not recorded` for a question it actually measured --

  # character admission salvaged is deliberately absent: the room lost nobody.
  #
  # COUNTED PER NAME AND NOT BY MEMBERSHIP, which is the difference between this
  # figure and a reading of the answer. A proposal off `Location::DetailSchema`
  # is a HASH, and `Character::Registry#resolve` matches a non-`Character`
  # candidate on `candidate.to_s` -- so a proposal never resolves to an existing
  # person by name. It goes to `#create_one` instead, where `#creation_refusal`
  # asks `#person_named?` and refuses it outright: *a person in this story is
  # already called that*. An answer that names one person twice therefore gets
  # ONE row and loses the other, and an answer naming somebody the story already
  # has gets none. Asking only whether the name appears in the records would
  # call every one of those admitted and report a room that lost somebody as
  # clean.

  # is left standing is what the room lost. A SELF-COLLISION is a refusal of the

  # a room that named one person twice and got one reads one of two.
  #
  # AND A SEAT IS A ROW THIS CALL PRODUCED, which is why the people already in
  # the stub are taken out of the tally first. `Eval::Realization::Stage` leaves
  # a seeded room's cast standing on purpose -- Neb Halloran is in the tide post
  # before anything is written -- so `after["people"]` holds the occupants as
  # well as the new arrivals. Seating a refused proposal against the very
  # occupant whose name refused it would report the room that lost somebody as

  # ---------------------------------------------------- the room's own numbers

  # THE DESCRIPTION AGAINST THE FLOOR PLAN THE PROMPT HANDED IT.
  #
  # WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. A room inside a laid-out place is the first thing in
  # this game whose prose can be checked against a NUMBER the app owns: the
  # extent and the storey were decided by `Location::Interior` before anybody
  # typed a line, `Location::Plan` states them in the detail prompt, and the
  # answer either agrees with them or does not. Every other reading of prose
  # this project has tried to ship died for wanting a judgement
  # (`Story::Audit`'s header, and `Story::Scoreboard`'s); this wants a
  # comparison.
  #
  # AND THE WALLS ARE NOT HERE, though the plan states them. Which wall the
  # prose put a door in was a check on this board through six measured grammars,
  # and each of them read a DOORLESS wall named in the same sentence as a door as
  # a door claim of its own -- which is the prose
  # `Location::Plan#closed_walls_clause` invites. It is
  # `Eval::Realization::UNAVAILABLE_TO_A_REALIZATION`'s
  # `door_in_a_wall_the_records_do_not_hold` now, with the reason on it. The
  # prompt is unchanged and still states every door's wall as fact; what no
  # longer exists is the claim to verify that in prose afterwards.
  #
  # WHAT IS AT STAKE IS THE PROSE AND NOT THE MAP, which is why this is not a
  # gate on anything. The doors are `LocationConnection` rows and no answer here
  # can add one -- `Location::Generator#write_exits!` asks a room of an interior
  # for no exits at all -- so a description that invents a door in the south
  # wall cannot move the player through it. What it produces is a room whose
  # prose argues with its own map, every turn, for the rest of the game.
  #
  # JUDGEABLE ONLY WHERE THERE IS A PLAN, and the denominator is the CLAIMS the
  # prose made rather than the cases: a description that states no measurement
  # has broken no rule -- the prompt asks for a room, not for a survey -- so
  # counting it in would report a rate the check never earned.
  # `Story::Audit#judgeable_for`'s rule, kept here.

  # THE SAME COMPARISON FOR THE TWO NUMBERS THE PROMPT STATED. A size is
  # compared UNORDERED, because a room described from the doorway is as honestly
  # four by six as six by four (`Story::Audit::Prose.size_claims`), and a storey
  # is compared as the integer the plan carries.
  #
  # AND THE EVIDENCE QUOTES BOTH SIDES AS THEY WERE WRITTEN, never as the
  # comparison normalised them: the claim in the order the prose put it
  # (`Size#as_written`) and the room in the order the prompt stated it
  # (`Location::Plan#size_sentence` says width by depth, so `#room_extent` does
  # too). A flag has to be legible against the prompt without opening the set --
  # `Story::Scoreboard`'s rule -- and a sorted pair is a pair neither the model
  # nor the records ever wrote.
  #
  # A NUMBER THE PROMPT STATED IS NEVER A DEFECT, and that is the whole rule --
  # stated once here rather than as a discount per sentence somebody remembered.
  # `Location::Plan` hands the model MORE than the room's own box: the place's
  # footprint, the far storey of every stair, and the clause naming storey 0 the
  # ground floor. A claim is a defect only when it contradicts EVERY number of
  # its kind the plan stated, so the comparison is against
  # `Reading#paces_stated` and `Reading#storeys_stated` -- both read off the plan
  # hash, so a sentence added to `Location::Plan` is covered here by
