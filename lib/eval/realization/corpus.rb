# THE CASES, AND THE THING THAT STOPS A CASE BEING A CLAIM.
#
# `test/fixtures/files/realization_corpus.yml` is stubs about to be written: a
# world, a room in it, the neighbour it was reached from, and the two lists that
# say what the rest of the world looked like at that moment. Every fact the
# model will be told is then read out of the records that world really holds --
# the universe, the preface, the places that already exist, the names already
# spoken for, how many people and things the registries will still admit -- so
# the prompt a case sends is `Location::Generator`'s and not this file's.
#
# WHY THE FACTS ARE NOT WRITTEN IN THE FILE, which is `Eval::Prompt::Corpus`'s
# argument and holds harder here: a realization prompt is four fifths world.
# A case that hand-wrote its universe and its known-places list would drift from
# the app the first time a line was added to either, and the drift would show up
# as a prompt change nobody made.
#
# WHAT THE VALIDATOR CATCHES, and it runs offline in `bin/rails test`:
#
#   * A world this bench has no file for, or one it does not play
#     (`Eval::Realization::STORIES`).
#   * A `room`, `reached_from`, `also_reaches`, `absent` or `unwritten` name the
#     world does not have -- the commonest way to write a case that measures
#     nothing, because the staging would raise and the case would be a hole in
#     the run.
#   * A `reached_from` or an `also_reaches` that is not actually connected to the
#     room, which would be claiming a way back -- or a neighbour this stub could
#     already reach -- that never existed. The second one is what stops a case
#     whose `why` describes a multi-exit stub from quietly staging a room with
#     one way out.
#   * A stub with no room left for a way out, which would skip the exits call
#     entirely (`Location::Generator#write_exits!`) and quietly halve the case.
#   * A missing `expects_new_ground`, because `no_new_ground` is only judgeable
#     where the case has declared whether this room is one the story points
#     into. A dead end that names only the way back is a CORRECT answer -- the
#     prompt asks for exactly that -- and scoring it as a defect would measure
#     the corpus.
#   * A missing `shape` or `why`. `shape` is what the board groups by; `why` is
#     what makes a case auditable.
#   * A `teaser` on a case whose room the world ALREADY has, which would be a
#     stub written twice and a teaser nothing reads.
#   * A `teaser` with no `danger`. `Location::Danger.for_a_new_room` is keyed on
#     the STORY'S ID, and a staged copy of a world is issued a new one on every
#     load -- so a typed stub that did not declare its danger would be born
#     quiet on one run and dangerous on the next, and every figure keyed on it
#     would move for no reason anybody could see.
#   * An `inside` or a `population` on a case that FINDS its room. Those two are
#     what a real exits call supplied about a place that did not exist yet; a
#     room the world already holds has them on its own row, and a case that
#     restated them would be hand-writing a world fact.
#   * An expectation naming a label the model is never offered, or a danger
#     floor that is not a rung of `Location::Parameters::LADDER` -- an
#     expectation that can never be earned reads on a board as the prompt
#     failing rather than as a typo.
#
# THE TWO KINDS OF CASE, AND THE ONE KEY THAT TELLS THEM APART.
#
#   A CASE THAT FINDS ITS ROOM is the original shape: a room in a checked-in
#   world file, wound back to the stub it was. Its identity is the world's.
#   A CASE THAT CARRIES ITS ROOM has a `teaser`, and `Eval::Realization::Stage`
#   CREATES the stub instead of finding one. That is the promotion path -- a
#   kind the captain typed in `Lab::Realization` and scored has no room in any
#   world file, so until a case could carry its own stub a scored kind could
#   never be re-run against a changed prompt.
#
# WHY THE STUB'S TWO FACTS MAY LIVE IN THE FILE WHEN THE UNIVERSE MAY NOT, which
# is the line this header draws above and the one a reader will think is being
# crossed: A NAME AND A TEASER ARE THE ROOM'S OWN FACTS AND NOT THE WORLD'S. The
# corpus already declares `danger` per case for exactly that reason. What stays
# forbidden is unchanged: the universe, the preface, the places that already
# exist and the names already spoken for are all still read out of the records
# the world really holds, so a promoted case sends `Location::Generator`'s prompt
# and not this file's.
#
# AND THE EXPECTATION IT CARRIES. A promoted case brings the captain's own
# `expects_*` block with it -- what he said the picks should come back as, off
# `Lab::Realization::PICKS`, each a subset of that pick's closed list and the
# danger one an ordinal floor. Every key obeys `expects_inside`'s rule: A KEY
# LEFT OUT IS *DON'T CARE* and takes the case out of that figure's numerator AND
# its denominator, because a rate a check did not earn is worse than no rate.
#
# NOTHING SCORES THE EXPECTATION YET, and that is stated here rather than left
# to be discovered: this slice ships the case that can carry one, the staging
# that can stand it up and the digest that folds it. The figure over it is the
# agreement half of the plan and is filed apart -- so a case may today declare
# an expectation for a pick its own shape can never be offered, and no validator
# here refuses that.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT CATCH is whether a case is worth measuring -- whether this
# stub, in this world, with these neighbours, puts the room builder anywhere
# near the failure a check is looking for. That is the hand-verification, and
# every case carries its `why`.

  #
  # THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPENDENCY IS DELIBERATE. A case carries a KIND's

  # id order produced a world state that never existed.
  #
  # `teaser`, `inside` and `population` ARE THE STUB'S OWN THREE FACTS and are

  # the captain typed, and the `inside` band and the `population` word are what

  #
  # `kind` AND `density` ARE THE WORDS THE CALL NEXT DOOR WOULD HAVE PICKED
  # (`Location::Kind`), and unlike `inside` and `population` a case that FINDS
  # its room may carry them too. Every world file the bench stages is older
  # than the words, so no room it finds has them on its own row, and a bench
  # whose rooms never carry a kind is blind to everything built on one -- the
