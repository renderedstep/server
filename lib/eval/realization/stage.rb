# THE MOMENT A ROOM WAS ABOUT TO BE WRITTEN, REBUILT FROM A SEED FILE.
#
# A realization prompt is almost entirely made of the world AROUND the room:
# the universe, the story's preface and summary, every place that already
# exists and which of them have been written, every name already spoken for,
# what this room can already reach, and how many people and things the
# registries will still admit. So a case that stored its own copy of those would
# be measuring a prompt the app does not build -- the same argument
# `Eval::Prompt::Corpus` makes for staging a position instead of writing the
# facts down. A case therefore names a WORLD and a ROOM IN IT, and this class
# puts the world back and winds that room back to the moment before it was
# written.
#
# THE THREE GUARANTEES ARE `Eval::Classifier::Stage`'S, and they are the reason
# this can be pointed at a machine somebody has been playing on:
#
#   1. ITS OWN COPY OF THE WORLD, loaded under a title of this class's own and
#      inside a transaction that is rolled back. Nothing outside the run is read
#      for the prompt, moved, or deleted -- including the surgery below, which
#      is what makes it safe to describe as deleting rooms.
#   2. NO MODEL CALL TO GET INTO POSITION. The whole of the setup is a seed load
#      and row surgery. The ONLY calls a case makes are the two being measured.
#   3. THE WORLD DOES NOT MOVE UNDERNEATH IT. No `Scene` is written and no turn
#      is played, so `WorldMechanic` never runs and the doorways are the ones
#      the file lists -- which is why this bench can build rooms in
#      `The Lunar Cartographer`, the world `Eval::Prompt::STORIES` has to
#      refuse. See `Eval::Realization::STORIES`.
#
# AND THE TITLE IS PUT BACK, always, for `Eval::Classifier::Stage`'s reason one
# step stronger: `Location::Generator#story_context` states the story's TITLE,
# its genre, its preface and its summary in the detail prompt, so a run staged
# on `The Salt Assizes (realization bench: vestry)` would be measuring a prompt
# no player ever gets -- and inviting the model to write the words "realization
# bench" into a room's lore.
#
# THE SURGERY, AND WHY IT IS DECLARED RATHER THAN DERIVED. Winding a room back
# means knowing which of its edges it wrote itself and which rooms did not exist
# yet, and NEITHER IS RECOVERABLE FROM THE RECORDS: connections carry no
# timestamp, and a room's `created_at` says when the row appeared and not what
# the world looked like around it. An earlier draft of this class tried to infer
# it from id order and produced a state that never existed. So the case says it,
# in the keys below, each one checked against the file by
# `Eval::Realization::Corpus`:
#
#   `room`          the stub to build. Wound back to a stub: no description, no
#                   lore, nothing lying in it -- or CREATED, when the case
#                   carries a `teaser` and the world has no such room.
#   `teaser`        the room's own second fact, and the key that decides which
#                   kind of case this is. A case with one carries its stub and
#                   this class creates it; a case without one names a room in a
#                   checked-in world file and this class finds it.
#   `inside`        the band a real exits call would have supplied about a place
#   `population`    it had just named, on a typed case only. Handed straight to
#                   `Location::Generator.create_stub!`, which is the app's own
#                   one path for a room being born.
#   `reached_from`  the ONE neighbour whose own realization created this stub,
#                   which is the way back. Absent for an opening room, which has
#                   none.
#   `also_reaches`  the other neighbours this stub could ALREADY reach, and the
#                   default is none. A room realized by being walked into has
#                   exactly one edge, so an ordinary case declares nothing here
#                   and every edge but the way back is removed. A SEEDED stub
#                   can legitimately have more -- a lane laid down with the
#                   circle at the end of it -- and those cases are the only
#                   place `exit_already_reachable` and `exit_over_the_allowance`
#                   meet a room with more than one way out and an allowance
#                   below the cap. Declared rather than kept-by-default for the
#                   reason the whole of this surgery is declared: which edges a
#                   stub really had is not recoverable from the records, so a
#                   case that wants them says so and the validator checks each
#                   one is really an edge.
#   `absent`        rooms that did not exist at this moment -- destroyed, so
#                   they are not in the "places that already exist" list and not
#                   in the taken names.
#   `unwritten`     rooms that existed but had not been written -- wound back to
#                   stubs, so the prompt does not mark them "already written --
#                   do not open a new way into it". This one changes what a
#                   correct answer IS, which is why it is a key and not a
#                   guess.
#
# A CASE THAT CARRIES ITS ROOM, AND WHY IT IS THIS CLASS'S JOB AND NOT A SECOND
# ONE'S. A kind the captain typed in `Lab::Realization` and scored is in no world
# file, so there is no room to find -- and until this class could CREATE one, a
# scored kind could never be re-run against a changed prompt, which is the whole
# of what "maintain alignment" means mechanically. So a case with a `teaser`
# stands its stub up through `Location::Generator.create_stub!` and opens the way
# in itself, and everything else -- the world load, the rename back, the readers
# on `Standing`, the rollback -- is unchanged and shared.
#
# ONE SPELLING OF STANDING A TYPED STUB UP. `Lab::Realization::Runner` carried
# its own copy of this while the corpus could not hold such a case, and its
# header said the copy was temporary. It now calls this class, so a lab draw and
# a promoted corpus case stand the same stub up in the same order -- which is the
# one thing they cannot afford to do subtly differently, since the point of the
# promotion is that the case re-runs what the lab scored.
#
# AND A TYPED CASE DECLARES ITS DANGER, checked by
# `Eval::Realization::Corpus#stub_problems`: the roll a new room would get is
# keyed on the story's id, which a staged copy is issued afresh on every load.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE: anybody standing in the room. A stub may
# legitimately have somebody in it -- a seed file places them -- and a person
# already here takes up one of `Character::Registry::MAX_PER_ROOM`'s slots and
# puts their name in the "already spoken for" list. Both of those are states the
# generator really meets, and removing the cast to tidy the case up would remove
# the two most interesting things about it.
class Eval::Realization::Stage
  # ONE COPY OF THE WORLD PER CASE, and the case's id is in the title because
  # that is what makes them separate copies. `WorldSeed::Loader` is idempotent

    # STORED PER ROOM RATHER THAN SUMMARISED, because the figure the captain
    # asked for is the share of rooms carrying a hazard BY STOREY and a summary
    # taken here could not be re-cut later. It is a handful of rows.
    #
    # AND SINCE SLICE 2 IT CARRIES WHERE EACH ROOM IS, which is what makes a

    # `index` IS THE ROOM'S PLACE IN THIS LIST AND IS THE ONLY WAY A DOOR NAMES A
    # ROOM. A database id would be an id from a transaction that was rolled back,

    # list is neither, and it is the same list the reader of the row iterates. So
    # `doors_to` and `stairs_to` hold indices into this array and nothing else.
    #
    # TWO KEYS AND NOT ONE, because a door and a stair are drawn differently and
    # the split is read off `LocationConnection#travel_method` rather than
    # derived from the two storeys differing. Deriving would be a second answer
    # to what a stair is; `Location::Interior::STAIRS` is the first.

    # ADJACENCY IS NOT A DOOR, which is why this has to be stored at all rather

    # touch usually have no door between them.
    #
    # A CONNECTION OUT OF THE BUILDING IS LEFT OUT -- `#open_the_way_in!` moves
    # the stub's own doorways onto a room of it, and that far end is not a
    # sibling, so it has no index here. The `doors` count still holds it, which
    # is what keeps the count the honest total it always was.
    #

  # story's arc if it was waiting for a place by this name -- all of which a row
  # written here by hand would have to remember to do.
  #
  # THE DECLARED DANGER IS APPLIED AFTER, which is `#wind_back!`'s own order for a
  # found room and here it is not optional: the roll is keyed on the story's id
  # and a staged copy is issued a new one on every load, so the case's own key is
  # the only reproducible answer. `Eval::Realization::Corpus` refuses a typed case
  # without one.
