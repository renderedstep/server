# GOLDEN VECTORS: THE ENGINE'S PURE RULES, WRITTEN DOWN AS INPUTS AND ANSWERS.
#
# Every file under `DIRECTORY` holds one portion of the engine -- the dice, a
# box's geometry, an interior's layout, the reading of a typed line -- as a
# list of cases, each a set of named inputs and the exact output this Ruby
# code gives for them. A second implementation of the same rules (a port to
# another language) is tested by reading these files and reproducing every
# output. So the files are a contract, and `docs/engine-vectors.md` says how
# to use and change them.
#
# THE FILES ARE GENERATED, NEVER HAND-EDITED. `rake engine:vectors` writes
# them and `test/lib/engine_vectors_test.rb` regenerates them in memory and
# compares, so any change to the Ruby behaviour shows up as a vector diff in
# the same PR that made it.
#
# EXCEPT THE PORTIONS THE ENGINE OWNS (`ENGINE_OWNED`): rules no Ruby code
# runs any more but the Ruby turn loop, which no player plays. Their files
# are the engine's, blessed there as a reviewed diff and vendored here byte
# for byte at the pinned commit (`EngineSweep::Vendored`), so this module
# neither writes nor regenerates them; a builder stays where the Ruby
# reference loop still runs its rule, so that loop can still be asked what it
# would have answered, and the request builders have none at all: everything
# here that needs a request asks the engine (`Playthrough::Requests`). A
# portion joins the list only once nothing but that loop runs its Ruby code:
# `world_mechanic` is not on it, because the debug view reads a mechanic's
# boundaries (`Playthrough::Debug`).
#
# OFFLINE AND WRITING NOTHING. No portion makes a model call. The portions
# that need rows (an interior, a shuffle, a deadline's anchor) build them with
# explicit ids inside a transaction that is always rolled back, so the answer
# does not depend on what else the database holds. The rake task goes further
# and runs against a fresh in-memory database loaded from `db/schema.rb`, so it
# never opens a database file at all.
#
# DETERMINISTIC BYTE FOR BYTE. Inputs come from plain arithmetic over fixed
# lists, every seed is an integer, and nothing reads the wall clock or a
# salted hash. Running the task twice gives identical files.
#
# THE FORMAT, VERSION `FORMAT_VERSION`. Each file is one JSON object:
#
#   format    always "engine-vectors"
#   version   `FORMAT_VERSION`; bumped when the shape of a file changes
#   portion   the file's name without `.json`
#   sources   the Ruby files whose behaviour the cases record
#   notes     how to read this portion's inputs and outputs
#   constants the tables the portion reads, where a port needs them verbatim
#             (a table is a list of [key, value] pairs, so key order is kept)
#   cases     one object per line: { "name", "input", "output" }
#
# A seed that can pass 2**53 is written as a decimal string; a System One
# reading is a JSON number between 0 and 1; every other number is a JSON
# integer. A time is whole seconds since the Unix epoch, UTC. The portions
# that pin a builder reading many tables take `records`, the rows the
# database held (`EngineVectors::Records`), or `records_of`, the name of the
# case whose rows they share.
