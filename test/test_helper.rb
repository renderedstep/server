# THE SUITE RUNS IN A DECLARED ENVIRONMENT, not in whoever's shell started it
# and not in whoever's `.env`. Every one of these changes how the app behaves,
# all of them are things a person working on this app legitimately has in `.env` or
# `.envrc`, and a test that reads one is asserting against a value it did not
# author:
#
#   OPENROUTER_API_KEY         `BaseAgent.default_model_options` puts the hosted
#                              models first when it is present, so tests that
#                              pin the answering model to a local one fail, and
#                              `RubyLLM.config.openrouter_api_key` is set from
#                              it at boot, so a test expecting an unconfigured
#                              provider to raise gets no exception. Three tests
#                              failed exactly this way for a worker with a key
#                              in their shell.
#   OPENROUTER_MODEL           prepended to `REMOTE_MODEL_IDS`.
#   TA_DEBUG_VIEW              `Playthrough::Debug.enabled?` obeys it in either
#                              direction, so `TA_DEBUG_VIEW=0` turns the whole
#                              debug view off and every test of it red.
#   TA_CHAT_KEEP_TURNS         both are read into `Chat` constants at class-load
#   TA_CHAT_HISTORY_EXCHANGES  time, which is why the first pass is BEFORE the
#                              require.
#   TYPESAFE_API_KEY           together with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
#                              `SystemOneAgent.configured?` is the whole of the
#                              System One cascade's switch, so a worker with
#                              either key in their shell would run every
#                              classifier test through a second model reader and
#                              a live network call. The keyless path is the one
#                              the suite asserts; a test that wants the cascade
#                              sets a key itself and puts it back (see
#                              `Playthrough::ClassifierPathsTest#with_key`).
#                              `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is already cleared above for
#                              BaseAgent; both must stay cleared for System One.
#   RELAY_OPENROUTER_API_KEY   `Relay.configured?` is the whole of the model
#                              relay's switch; the relay tests set a fake key
#                              themselves and stub the upstream.
#
# It takes TWO passes, and the second one is not belt-and-braces. `dotenv-rails`
# is in the `:development, :test` group, so it loads `.env` while
# `config/environment` boots -- and dotenv declines to override only the keys it
# finds already set. Deleting them beforehand therefore *hands it* the opening
# to put them straight back, which is exactly what it does: with the first pass
# alone, `ENV["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"]` and `RubyLLM.config.openrouter_api_key` are
# both populated again by the time the first test runs, on any checkout with a
# `.env`. Measured, not assumed. So: once before the require, for the constants
# frozen at class-load time, and once after it, for dotenv.
#
# A test that wants one of these sets it itself and puts it back -- see
# `BaseAgentTest#with_env` and `Playthrough::DebugTest#with_env`.

# own `EngineSweep::Parity::InProcess`). A test of the Ruby turn loop itself
# builds a `Playthrough::Turn` by name.
