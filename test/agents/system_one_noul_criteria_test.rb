# EVERY NOUL QUESTION THE APP SENDS NAMES BOTH OF ITS ENDS.
#
# The provider refuses a Noul question whose `criteria` lacks a `true` or a
# `false` string, and it refuses the whole request with it -- so one empty
# criteria map turns every call that carries it into a 400 and hands the room
# back to the die without a single answer. The volition request shipped that
# way and nothing offline noticed, because its pinned fixture pinned the empty
# map along with everything else.
#
# So this builds each request the game sends -- the engine builds both, through
# `Playthrough::Requests` -- for a room with somebody and something in it, and
# checks every Noul question in it. The source scan at the bottom keeps it that
# way: a Ruby file that writes a Noul question of its own fails here.
