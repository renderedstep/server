# THE TWO BLOCKS `ta-quest-outcomes` ADDED TO THE FILE FORMAT, THERE AND BACK.
#
#   an outcome's `when:` / `minutes:` / `beat:` / `alive:` / `ramification:` -- which of several
#   endings a game reaches, and what the world does about it afterwards
#   the story's `schedule:` -- a thing this world has already decided will
#   happen, which is the captain's Call 8 of 2026-09-06
#
# ROUND-TRIPPED AGAINST THE CHECKED-IN WORLDS rather than against a synthetic
# document, because those are the files that would break: the Iron Gate carries
# the only conditional ending in the repository and the Lunar Cartographer the
# only schedule, and an exporter that quietly dropped either would leave a
# re-exported world with an ending nobody can reach and a clock that owes
# nothing.
