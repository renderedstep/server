# THE VERIFICATION OF THE HAND-WRITTEN CASES, run in CI.
#
# A corpus of ninety cases is only worth what its checking is worth, and the
# part a person gets wrong is not the English -- it is naming a thing that is
# not in reach, or writing a case that would quietly buy a second model call.
# So every case is staged against the closed set its action really reads, and a
# case that does not fit fails the build.
#
# IT COSTS NOTHING. Each position is staged offline out of its own copy of a
# seeded world, inside a transaction that is rolled back, with `BaseAgent.new`
# replaced so a model call from anywhere raises -- the same three guarantees
# `rake game:sweep` runs on. No key, no network, no spend.
