# THE ENDING PROMPT'S OWN BASELINE, RE-BOUGHT SO THE FIGURE IS LIVE AGAIN.
#
# `Eval::Prompt::KeptSetTest` one file over does this for the 2026-09-05
# baseline of the ninety-case corpus. This is the pair the ending prompt is
# judged against -- both sides, so the verdict replays offline and free.
#
# WHY THERE ARE TWO PAIRS ON DISK AND THIS FILE PINS THE SECOND ONE. The pair
# `ta-quest-ending` bought (PR 162) read `item_not_held` 0.000 -> 0.200 REAL,
# and the diagnosis was the CHECK: `Story::Audit::Prose.item_names` aliased
# `iron key` to **iron**, which is a word of this world's central place, the
# IRON GATE. PR 164 fixed that -- an item's alias is its own last word and never
# an earlier one -- but **a kept set is a summary and holds no prose**
# (`Eval::Prompt::Result#summary`), so the fix could not re-score the figure it
# invalidated. It could only be re-bought. The captain authorized that on
# 2026-09-08 and this is it: same corpus, same model, same four repetitions a
# side, the before side staged the same way, and NOTHING model-facing changed
# between the two pairs -- the `ending` instructions digest is identical across
# both after sides, which is asserted below.
#
# THE 2026-09-08 PAIR STAYS ON DISK AS HISTORY and keeps its place in
# `Eval::MEASUREMENT_FILES`; the test at the bottom of this file is what says
# what it is and why nothing may be concluded from its rates any more.
#
# NO DATABASE, NO KEY, NO NETWORK. That is the point rather than a convenience:
# the calls were paid for once and the numbers are judgeable for ever by
# somebody who never paid for one.
