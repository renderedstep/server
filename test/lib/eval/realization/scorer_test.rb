# stored facts -- so the whole of it is testable from a literal, which is the
# point of storing the facts beside the answer in the first place. What each
# test pins is the DENOMINATOR as much as the flag: a check that fired on the
# right row and counted the wrong opportunities reports a rate nobody can read.
