# on a scratch copy of the database, deleted afterwards. See `EngineSweep`.

# else, so it names the script, the step, what was typed and both sides of the
# expectation that did not hold -- `EngineSweep::Result::Failure` builds it and
# `test/lib/engine_sweep_test.rb` is where that is proved rather than hoped for.
