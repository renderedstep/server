# `dead_shown_alive`, `carried_shown_lying` AND `handover_invented`, MEASURED
# THE WAY EVERY OTHER CHECK HERE WAS -- and they are the first to read
# `Scene#engine_fact`, the receipt of what the engine handed a scene's writer.
#
# THE DEFECT BEHIND THEM is the arrival and NPC study kept under
# `db/eval/adversarial-20260909`: with the right facts in the prompt, prose
# still put a carried key back on the desk, stood a dead woman up to watch the
# player come in, and had a character hand over a key the engine never moved.
# Its own conclusion was that correct context does not guarantee correct
# prose. The receipt makes the facts durable; these read the prose against it.
#
# THE MEASUREMENT, ON EVERY STORED SET THAT CARRIES A RECEIPT BESIDE ITS PROSE:
#
#   set                          rows  receipt            flags
#   adversarial arrival, after     12  in the prompt      1  carried_key:2
#   arrival-branches               32  facts.current      2  carried_key:2,
#                                                            floor_and_carried:4
#   adversarial NPC, after         20  fact               0

#
# FIVE FLAGS ON 136 REAL RECEIPTS, AND EVERY ONE WAS READ. The arrival flag in
# the study is one its readers labelled a contradiction ("the brass key resting
# there", of a key the player carries); the two arrival-branches flags are the
# same sentence in a later run of the same case. The two dialogue flags are a
# refused gift -- the receipt says the engine REJECTED it and nothing moved --
# narrated as "hands it to you" and "places the brass key in your hand". Those
# four were read by the author of this check, not by an independent reader, and
# say so here rather than borrowing the study's authority.
#
# THE LABELS, where the study's readers left them. Arrival descriptions were
# labelled blind by two readers who agreed on every contradiction; the NPC
# narrations by the study's own audit. The study's BEFORE arms predate the
# receipt, so their receipts are supplied rather than recorded -- the arrival
# case's own after-arm receipt (the fixture's records are identical in both
# arms), and for NPC turns the engine's receipt for a turn that moved nothing,
# which is what the before arm's engine did on every row:
#
#   check                 scope                      TP  FP  FN  TN
#   dead_shown_alive      8 dead_resident arrivals    4   0   0   4
#   carried_shown_lying   8 carried_key arrivals      4   0   0   4
#   handover_invented     28 unchanged NPC turns      1   0   5  22
#
# The arrival pair catches all eight labelled arrival contradictions and
# nothing else. The handover's five misses are stated below: one handover the
# negation guard gives up, and four ceasefires accepted in dialogue, which no
# grammar tells from a proposal and which the check does not claim to read.
#
# AND BECAUSE THOSE SETS ARE ONE WORLD, ONE KEY AND ONE WOMAN, the grammars were
# also pointed at the four corpora they were not written against -- 424 real
# passages -- with a receipt PLANTED under each: everybody the checked-in worlds
# name recorded dead, every item carried, no possession moved. Every detection
# was read. Each of the living-act detections is a named person really
# standing, watching or speaking; each of the lying detections really puts the
# thing on a surface or lifts it off one; the handover grammar reads nothing.
# That is the reading precision on prose nobody tuned it to: whenever the
# receipt says the opposite, those sentences are contradictions.
