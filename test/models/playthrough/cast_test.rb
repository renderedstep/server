# GAME.

# `Playthrough#cast_in` is the exact counterpart of `#items_lying_in` one table
# over, and it is here for that method's reason: `Character.present_in` is the
# WORLD's answer, and since a playthrough can take somebody's last hit point the
# world's answer is no longer this game's. Before it, `talk to Rowe` on a corpse
# resolved, reached the exchange (`Playthrough::Turn#converse`), and the corpse answered.
#
# THE FOUR READERS EACH HAVE A TEST HERE, because a reader left on the world's
# answer is exactly the shape of the defect this closes.
