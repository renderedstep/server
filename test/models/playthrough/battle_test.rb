# WHAT THE PANEL SAYS, AND THAT EVERY WORD OF IT IS A RECORD READ BACK.
#
# The captain's call C9 of 2026-09-05 -- ***"go with buttons for now"*** -- is
# shape (a) of the combat scout's §12: buttons posting fixed commands, condition
# lines rather than bars, no narrator and no classifier. This file is the half
# of it that can be asserted without a browser: what is on the panel, what is
# not, and that a fight is entered and left by DERIVATION and never by a flag.
#
# NOTHING HERE MAKES A MODEL CALL, and it is not stubbed out to keep it that
# way: `Playthrough::Battle` reads `Playthrough#foes_in`, `#cast_in`,
# `#vitals_for`, `#exits` and `Playthrough::Fight`, all of which are queries.

  # answers with nobody -- so the panel is correctly off and the assertion
  # correctly fails. `Roll`'s seed is built out of row ids and the story clock,
  # so which face comes up moves with how many rows the run wrote before it:
  # it passed on `main`, and it came up 8 in CI once this file grew. A fixture
