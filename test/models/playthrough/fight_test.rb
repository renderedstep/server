# WHETHER THIS GAME IS IN A FIGHT, WHEN IT IS OVER, AND THE ONE `Scene` THAT
# CLOSES IT.
#
# THE FIGHT-END RULE IS WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, and it is exactly three things:
# no live foe is left standing in the room it happened in, the party is no
# longer standing in that room, or the player is dead. Each of the three has a
# test, and so does the fourth case that is not an ending -- a foe still up and
# the party still there.

    # the three seeded worlds give their protagonists. It is here so that a

    # with one. Every test here that DOES want him down puts him down with
    # `#harm!`, which is exact.
