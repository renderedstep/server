# THE TYPED VOLITION REQUEST, WITH NO MODEL CALL ANYWHERE IN IT.
#
# The request is the engine's (`volition::request`, through
# `Playthrough::Requests`): what a turn the game plays asks System One about
# who in a room does what. Its exact bytes for one staged room are pinned
# (`test/fixtures/files/volition_system_one_request.json`, rewritten only when
# the request is meant to change), because `rake eval:volition_probe` sends
# that file and nothing else. How an answer becomes an act is the engine's
# too, and is held there; the Ruby reference loop the suite plays asks nobody.
