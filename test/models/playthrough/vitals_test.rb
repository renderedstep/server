# HOW MUCH IS LEFT OF ONE BODY IN ONE GAME.
#
# The captain's ruling of 2026-09-04 applied to people: the world owns the stat
# block and the playthrough owns the condition. What these pin is the split
# itself -- one game's wound is invisible to another -- and the two rules the
# table stands on: an absent row means unhurt, and zero means dead.
