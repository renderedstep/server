# WHO IS FIGHTING THIS PARTY, HERE, IN THIS GAME. `Playthrough#foes_in` is the
# one reader of it, and what it is for is the join: the WORLD says who is
# hostile (`characters.hostile`) and a GAME says who is still standing
# (`playthrough_vitals`). Either half read alone is the wrong answer, and this
# is the test that says so.
#
# SINCE THE CAPTAIN'S SIXTH RULING OF 2026-09-05 THERE ARE TWO WAYS ONTO THAT
# LIST -- *"anyone can be attacked"* -- so the join is three-cornered now: the
# world's `characters.hostile`, this game's `playthrough_vitals.provoked_at`,
# and this game's dead. One reader, so a fight, a read-out and a sweep cannot
# come to three different answers.
