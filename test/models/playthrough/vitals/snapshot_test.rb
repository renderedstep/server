# much is left of them -- the people half of `Item::Snapshot`, taken at the same
# moments through `Playthrough::Snapshot`.
#
# The rule these pin is the seam: neither half may be taken without the other,
# because a room whose things a game has copied and whose people it has not is a
# silent inconsistency nothing would report.
