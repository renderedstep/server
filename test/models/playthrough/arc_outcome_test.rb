# WHICH OF SEVERAL ENDINGS ONE GAME REACHED, AND WHAT THE WORLD DOES ABOUT IT.
#
# The captain's note of 2026-09-06: *"multiple endings to a quest must be
# possible. a failed quest gets stored as an event that can have future
# ramifications."* `Playthrough::ArcTest` one file over pins the four triggers
# and the ending being written at all; this pins WHICH one is written, and the
# rows that follow it.
#
# EVERY ONE OF THESE IS DRIVEN BY WRITING THE RECORD THE GAME WOULD HAVE
# WRITTEN AND ASKING -- no model anywhere, which is the standing constraint and
# also the only reason a rule like this can be tested at all.
