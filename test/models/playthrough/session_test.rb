# `Playthrough::Session` is the one way a front end reaches the turn loop. The
# browser's own tests (the playthroughs and turns controllers, `NarrationJob`
# and the engine sweep's browser turns) are what prove the browser plays
# through it unchanged; these pin the session's own answers, and the guard.

  # A turn played here is played by the Rust engine, as a player's is
  # (`PlaysOnRust`).

  # ONE LOOP, ONE WAY IN. A front end that builds its own `Playthrough::Turn`
  # has taken a share of the loop the session exists to own -- the outcome's
  # wording, the start of a game, the order lines are accepted in -- and the
  # engine can then disagree with itself. So the places front ends live are
  # read for the call, and a new one there fails here with its file named.
  #
  # `lib/eval/` stages are measuring instruments, not front ends: each plants
  # a fixture inside a turn (a replayed exchange, a scripted blow) to hold the
  # rest of the loop still while one prompt is measured, which is exactly what
  # a front end must not do. They are named one by one, so a new file there
  # is still read.
