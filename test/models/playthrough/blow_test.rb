  # A blow points at a playthrough, two characters, a room and (once the fight
  # is closed) a Scene, and four of those five are NOT NULL. `rake game:delete`
  # tears a story down in association order -- characters, then locations, then
  # scenes, then playthroughs -- so a row left pointing at any of them raises a
  # foreign key error halfway through and leaves the story half-deleted. These
  # are the four statements that stop that, and they are tests rather than
  # assumptions because it is the shape a `dependent:` nobody wrote fails in.

  # The rows a fight that killed somebody leaves: a blow its closing scene
  # claimed, the killing blow, and the body kept where it fell.
