# The engine with the prose taken out. What matters here is not what anything
# read like -- nothing reads like anything -- it is that after every command the
# DATABASE says what the read-out said, and that a refused command changed
# nothing at all.
#
# TWO PATHS IN, AND THE FILE IS SPLIT ALONG THEM:
#
#   `play`      the offline mode (`model: false`), run with `BaseAgent.new`
#               RAISING. That guarantee is asserted rather than assumed -- no
#               API key is deleted, no network is blocked, nothing is hoped for.
#               If any path through the offline mode ever reaches for a model,
#               every test using this helper fails on the spot.
#   `interpret` the default mode, driven through a FakeAgent standing in for
#               every BaseAgent the command builds. The queued responses ARE the
#               model calls the mode is allowed to make, in order, and running
#               out of them raises -- so a narrator call this mode must not make
#               fails the test loudly instead of passing quietly.
#
# The world is shaped like `the-unrecorded-hour.yml` -- an opening room, a
# realized dead end off it, an unwritten stub, something on each floor and
# something in the protagonist's hands -- and built with factories rather than
# loaded from the seed file, because `SeededWorldsTest` is deliberately the one
# test that reads those.
