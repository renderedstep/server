# THE FOUR TRIGGERS, READ OFF RECORDS, AND THE ENDING THEY LEAD TO.
#
# These pin the standing constraint applied to plot: a beat is reached because
# the app read a row, never because a model said so -- so every one of them is
# driven by writing the record the game would have written and asking.
#
# AND THE LAYER SPLIT, which is the other half: one player's beat is invisible
# to another player of the same world.
