# ZERO HIT POINTS MEANS DEATH, AND DEATH ENDS THE PLAYTHROUGH.
#
# The captain's ruling of 2026-09-04, verbatim: *"zero hit points means death.
# Playthrough is over and you can't do anything else. You have to start a new
# playthrough. Eventually, we can add going back to saved previous state."*
#
# `lib/engine_sweep/scripts/death-ends-a-playthrough.yml` walks the ruling
# through the engine one typed line at a time; these are the statements
# underneath it -- the transition itself, what it costs (nothing), and the two
# doors it must be in front of.
