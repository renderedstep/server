# THE LAST PARAGRAPH, AND THE SENTENCE UNDERNEATH IT.
#
# `Playthrough::ArcOutcomeTest` pins which ending a game reaches and
# `Playthrough::TurnEndingTest` pins the turn that renders one. This is the
# pass itself: what it is told, what it writes, and -- most of the tests here --
# what a game is left with when the call does not come back.
#
# EVERY FALLBACK CASE IS ONE ASSERTION MADE FOUR WAYS, on purpose. A refusal, a
# suppressed crisis response, a dropped connection and a paragraph cut in half
# are four different failures with one required outcome: the player still has an
# ending, and it is the engine's own sentence.

  # `db/eval/prompt-ending-*-2026-09-08` -- see EVALUATION.md and

  # the ninety-case corpus, because `Eval::Prompt.digest` is over the cases and
  # the 2026-09-05 baseline is the before side for the prompts those cases send.
  #
  # SO THIS IS THE CANARY ON THE OTHER CORPUS. Every world it plays has an arc
  # now, so a case COULD end a game: one staged a beat from the end whose line
  # takes that beat. `Eval::Prompt::Corpus#concluding_problems` refuses such a
  # case offline, and this asserts none is in the file -- so no case in it
  # reaches this pass, and its kept set measures prose and nothing else.
