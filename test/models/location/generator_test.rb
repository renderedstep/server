  # THE CAPTAIN'S CALL 7 OF 2026-09-08, and the case is the exits-lab scout's
  # own replay of a STORED answer (its section 7.1): `Location::ExitsSchema`
  # asks for a name of "1 to 4 words, no article" while the prompt lists the
  # world's places as stored, articles and all, so the model correctly answered
  # `Causeway Court` and `Vestry Hulk` for a world holding `The Causeway Court`
  # and `The Vestry Hulk`. `#find_location` matched exactly, missed, and the
  # engine wrote a second row for each -- one of them with a footprint and a
  # floor plan to come.
  #
  # THE ANSWER IS THE SCOUT'S, SHAPE AND NAMES BOTH, including the causeway
  # named twice over -- once as stored and once without its article -- because
  # that is what made the duplicate legible: the same place reaching this method
  # twice must come out as one door and not as two rows.
